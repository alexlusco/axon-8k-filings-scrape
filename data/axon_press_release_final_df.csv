"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov 24, 2009 (GlobeNewswire via COMTEX) -- TASER International, Inc. (Nasdaq:TASR), a leading provider of technology solutions and the market leader in electronic control devices (ECDs), announced that on November 23, 2009, the Prosecuting Attorney cleared a Fort Smith police officer in a deadly officer involved shooting. The incident was captured during a pilot program of the AXON on-officer tactical computer and audio-video recorder that captures incidents from the officer's perspective. The critical video image was uploaded, securely stored and reviewed by investigators on the EVIDENCE.COM Software as a Service (SaaS) platform within hours of the event., The Prosecuting Attorney released his official report yesterday clearing Fort Smith Police Cpl. Brandon Davis from any criminal charges in reference to the Officer Involved Shooting that occurred on November 11, 2009., ""I must also mention my review of the AXON recording of the above detailed event,"" said Prosecuting Attorney, Daniel Shue. ""This new technological tool recorded the entire incident by both audio and video. Though there are several third-party witnesses, as well as the officers' own recollections of some of the events leading up to the weapons discharge, this technology enabled this office to observe what happened with complete objectivity."", ""Although the outcome of this incident is tragic, we are proud the AXON video was helpful in the investigation of this event in order to protect the truth of what actually happened,"" said Tom Smith, chairman and founder of TASER International. ""The Fort Smith Police Department is one of the first law enforcement agencies to field test TASER's AXON and EVIDENCE.COM solution. This video clearly demonstrates the power of the AXON on-officer camera and the ability to provide a centralized secure repository and software service to manage, access and view digital evidence. This is a powerful validation of our two-year effort to develop our comprehensive EVIDENCE.COM SasS solution."", Per a Freedom of Information Act (FOI) request, the entire video was released earlier today by the Fort Smith police to each of the area news stations. A KFSM news story can be viewed at: http://tinyurl.com/yhhoomj., Synopsis of the Officer Involved Shooting:, Officers arrived to investigate a complaint of felony terroristic threatening and assault involving a firearm by the husband to his wife. She met the officers outside and willingly opened the door for the officers to make contact with the husband. Upon opening the door, the officers were met by the husband sitting at the kitchen table holding a pistol and pointing it at them. After telling the husband 9 times to drop the pistol, Cpl. Davis fired twice and struck the husband, who did not survive the incident. The entire incident was caught on Cpl. Davis's AXON system and uploaded to EVIDENCE.COM for secure digital evidence storage and review., EVIDENCE.COM is a world-class, Web 3.0 cloud computing service providing secure digital video storage and groundbreaking analytic capabilities.

"The Court noted that ""California courts require that plaintiffs present evidence of 'general recogni[tion] and prevailing best scientific and medical knowledge' to meet the 'known or knowable' element of a strict liability claim."" In addition, the court noted that the ""evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to raise a triable issue as to 'knowability' of the risk,... [and] insufficient to create a triable issue as to whether TASER should have known of the risk."", The Court also noted that ""TASER has developed a comprehensive warning system in which every ECD sold or distributed is accompanied by a training CD/DVD and operating manual to be used by TASER-certified instructors,"" and that Defendant's expert Dr. Raymond Fish ""unequivocally rejects the theory that ECDs on humans decrease respiration and cause dangerous acidosis."", In granting TASER's motion for summary judgment, the Court stated that TASER International's assertions ""are well-taken"" that there are no genuine issues of material fact with regard to whether, ""the alleged propensity of ECDs to cause metabolic acidosis was known or knowable on December 30, 2003, when the ECDs in question were shipped from TASER to its distributor; [and]... TASER's warnings with respect to the dangers posed by application of its ECDs were adequate..."", ""It is important to note that this case was brought by the same plaintiff's counsel, using fundamentally the same liability theory as the Heston case in 2008,"" and ""it is ironic that this case is won in the same week as TASER filed its opening appellate brief in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Heston case,"" said Doug Klint, President and General Counsel of TASER International. ""Studies published since the Heston trial have largely disproven the acidosis theory, demonstrating that the exertion effects associated with TASER® ECD discharges are lower than several other physical force tactics. We believe the findings from the court in this most recent case is an important landmark for both law enforcement and the Company.

"The supplemental use of force policy approved by Attorney General Anne Milgram allows law enforcement officers in New Jersey the use of electronic stun devices in limited circumstances involving emotionally disturbed individuals.

"According to Waukesha Police, officers responded to a report of a suicidal woman with a knife. She was not only threatening her own life, but the life of another. Upon arrival officers received information that the subject of the call was a 47-year-old woman with a history of mental illness., Officers located the woman in a highly agitated state. In order to safely take her into protective custody officers deployed the XREP. The deployment was successful and no higher forms of force were needed. Neither the woman nor any officers were injured., ""This is a momentous event for our law enforcement partners as this is the first life protected without injury outside of our pilot programs through the combined use of our production advanced wireless TASER XREP and our TASER X12 Less Lethal Shotgun,"" said Tom Smith, Chairman and founder of TASER International. ""We are pleased with the performance of these two life-saving systems integrating successfully. We applaud the Waukesha Police Department's successful intervention to protect life with TASER technology."", About TASER XREP and TASER X12, The XREP is a wireless self-contained electronic ECD deployed from a 12-gauge pump-action. It delivers a similar Neuro Muscular Incapacitation (NMI) bio-effect as our handheld TASER® X26 ECD with a maximum effective range approaching 100 feet (30.48 meters)., The battery supply is fully integrated into the chassis and provides the power to drive the XREP projectile engine and thereby ""wireless"" compared to traditional hand held TASER ECDs., While the XREP can be deployed from any 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, Mossberg and TASER International joined forces to produce the TASER® X12 LLS, utilizing a re-engineered Mossberg 500 pump-action shotgun to optimize the TASER XREP. The TASER X12 includes Radial Key Ammunition technology to prevent the system from deploying lethal 12-gauge rounds in order to remove the possibility of end users accidentally firing a lethal round in a less-lethal system during high stress situations., No other system on the market today prevents the operator from inadvertently deploying a lethal round. In addition, it incorporates a uniquely designed twist, rifled barrel that optimizes the performance of the XREP, ensuring that an optimum spin rate is imparted upon the projectile as it exits the barrel to ensure the greatest distance, stabilization, and accuracy possible., For more information about the XREP and X12 systems visit:, http://www.taser.com/products/law/Pages/TASERXREP.aspx, http://www.taser.com/products/law/Pages/TASERX12.aspx, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International's products Protect Life and Protect Truth.

"During the third quarter, the Company announced a trade-in program to enable agencies to easily upgrade to the newly announced semi-automatic TASER X3. As required by applicable accounting principles, the Company deferred $3.5 million of revenue until the respective trade-in occurs or the trade-in program expires at December 31, 2009. This temporary deferral significantly reduces GAAP reported net sales as compared to adjusted revenue for product shipments. Additionally, all the product costs associated with the sale were recognized at the time of delivery to the customer. In order to simplify comparison to prior periods, the Company will discuss both its GAAP and its adjusted (non-GAAP) results assuming this revenue was not deferred., Q3 Financial Summary:, * Adjusted revenues for the third quarter of 2009 were $26.8
   million, an increase of $4.0 million or 17% over the same quarter
   of the prior year. For the first nine months of 2009, adjusted
   revenues were $73.2 million, an increase of $6.8 million or 10.0%
   over the first nine months of 2008. Adjusted revenues exclude the
   impact of a $3.5 million revenue deferral related to the X26 to X3
   trade-in credit program, the balance of which is expected to be
   recognized as revenue when the trade-in occurs or the offer expires
   at December 31, 2009. On a GAAP basis, net sales for the third
   quarter and first nine months of 2009 were $23.3 million and $69.7
   million, respectively. Net sales for the third quarter and first
   nine months of 2008 were $22.9 million and $66.4 million,
   respectively.  * Adjusted gross margin, which excludes the impact of the X26 to X3
   trade-in credit program, improved to 62.5% in the third quarter of
   2009, compared to 60.8% in the third quarter of 2008.  On a GAAP
   basis, gross margin for the third quarter was 56.9%, compared to
   60.8% in the third quarter of 2008. * Research and development expenses of $6.7 million increased by
   $3.3 million, or 100%, in the third quarter of 2009 compared to
   the same period in 2008. The increase was driven primarily by
   ongoing, intensive development efforts to bring multiple new
   products to market including the TASER® X3, TASER® AXON
   and EVIDENCE.COM.  The accelerated research and development costs
   were associated with the simultaneous launch of two major product
   lines in the quarter: the new TASER X3 and the AXON Tactical
   Computer. The Company expects R&D costs to return to more normal
   levels in the fourth quarter. * Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2009, which
   excludes the X26 to X3 trade-in revenue deferral, stock-based
   compensation charges, depreciation and amortization and litigation
   judgment expense, was $0.6 million compared to $2.8 million for the
   third quarter of 2008. GAAP loss from operations was $(4.8) million
   for the third quarter of 2009 compared to income from operations of
   $1.5 million for the same period in the prior year. * Net loss and diluted loss per share for the third quarter of 2009
   were $(3.2) million and $(0.05), respectively. * The Company generated $5.5 million in cash from operating
   activities in the first nine months of 2009 with ending cash and
   cash equivalents of $45.4 million and no debt., Significant events in the third quarter of 2009 include the following:, 1. International sales represented 19% of net sales and 16% of
    adjusted revenues for the third quarter (including the impact of
    revenue deferred for GAAP purposes relating to the X26 to X3
    trade-in program).  Significant shipments during the third quarter
    included follow-on orders for 1962 TASER® X26 ECDs, 1962
    TASER CAMs and related accessories to Australia. 2. Sales to our Federal and military customers significantly
    increased during the quarter, partly due to the first order for
    TASER® X26 ECDs and cartridges shipped under an indefinite
    delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract from the U.S.
    Customs and Border Protection (CBP). 3. On July 27, 2009, the next generation TASER® X3 ECD was
    unveiled at the annual TASER Conference. The TASER X3 is capable
    of firing three cartridges without reloading and uses a Pulse
    Calibration System to constantly monitor and calibrate
    electrical output to provide more consistent effects on the
    target. 4. Six (6) product liability suits were dismissed during the
    quarter, representing at the end of the quarter a total of
    ninety-six (96) wrongful death or injury suits that have been
    dismissed or judgment entered in favor of the Company., ""I am extremely proud of our team, which was able to turn in one of the strongest sales quarters in our Company's history despite the challenging economic environment,"" said Rick Smith, CEO of TASER International. ""In addition to the strong sales for our existing products, our new AXON and EVIDENCE.com products continue to receive widespread praise from the law enforcement community. Both products recently received top industry awards at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in the law enforcement computer and software categories, which is a great start as we prepare to bring these products to market in 2010. The investments we have made in these transformative products have positioned the Company to build on our reputation as not only the leading name in ECDs, but a pioneer in defense-oriented technologies and software services as well."", The Company will host its third quarter 2009 earnings conference call on Thursday, October 22, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. ET.

The pass code is 26406262 for both numbers., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's Statements of Operations presented in accordance with GAAP, we are presenting non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. We have presented these measures for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods and have shown a reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures in the tables at the end of this release. These non-GAAP measures include: (1) for adjusted revenue and adjusted gross margin, the impact of sales that were made during the third quarter pursuant to our X26 to X3 trade-in credit program that for GAAP purposes the resulting revenues were deferred until the sooner of when the offer is redeemed or the trade-in upgrade period expires, which will be no later than December 31, 2009 (""deferred sales"") and (2) for income (loss) from operations, the impact of deferred sales, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization and litigation judgment expense. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our ""recurring core business operating results,"" meaning our operating performance excluding non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and other discrete charges that are infrequent in nature. Additionally, because the temporary non-cash revenue deferral for the X26 to X3 trade-in credit program significantly reduces GAAP reported net sales as compared to adjusted revenue for product shipments, and whereas all the product costs associated with the sale were recognized at the time of delivery to the customer, the presentation of adjusted results assuming this revenue was not deferred simplifies the comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, As noted previously, these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and the impact of other non-cash charges. Management believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, * these non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness
   and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's
   GAAP financial measures; * these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in
   isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP
   financial measures; * these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be
   superior to the Company's GAAP financial measures; and * these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance
   with GAAP and investors should not assume that the non-GAAP
   financial measures presented in this earnings release were
   prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principles., Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release., About TASER International, Inc.

"Q2 Financial Summary:, * For the second quarter of 2009 revenues were $21.8 million, an
   increase of $0.7 million or 3.5% over the same quarter of the
   prior year.  On a year to date basis, revenues for the first half
   of 2009 were $46.4 million, an increase of $2.9 million or 6.5%
   over the first half of 2008.  
 * Gross margin decreased to 62.9% in the second quarter of 2009,
   compared to 64.5% in the second quarter of 2008.  Sequentially,
   gross margins improved from 59.5% primarily due to a more favorable
   change in sales mix to higher margin ECDs from lower margin
   cartridges. * Research and development expenses of $4.4 million increased by
   $1.4 million, or 45.4%, in the second quarter of 2009 compared to
   the same period in 2008. This was driven by intensive development
   efforts on multiple new products including the TASER® X3,
   TASER® AXON, EVIDENCE.COM and TASER® XREP.

 * Non-GAAP income from operations for the second quarter of 2009,
   which excludes stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and
   amortization and litigation judgment expense, was $0.7 million
   compared to $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2008. GAAP loss
   from operations was $(1.5) million for the second quarter of 2009
   compared to $(4.3) million for the same period in the prior year. * Net loss and diluted loss per share for the second quarter of 2009
   were $(0.7) million and $(0.01), respectively. * The Company generated $8.2 million in cash from operating
   activities in the first half of 2009 with ending cash and cash
   equivalents of $52.8 million and zero debt., Significant events in the second quarter of 2009 include the following:, 1. On June 30, 2009 the Company announced the availability of the
    self-contained wireless TASER XREP shotgun rounds, as well as the
    commercial launch of the TASER® X12 Less-Lethal Shotgun (LLS)
    by Mossberg®.  The XREP is a wireless ECD capable of delivering
    the proven TASER Neuro Muscular Incapacitation effect to a maximum
    range of 100 feet. 2. International sales represented 17% of total net sales for the
    second quarter, compared to 12% in the second quarter of 2008 and
    37% in the first quarter of 2009.  Significant shipments during
    the second quarter included follow-on orders for TASER® X26
    ECDs and cartridges to the UK, Australia and Korea. 3. Seven (7) product liability suits were dismissed during the
    quarter, representing at the end of the quarter a total of
    ninety-one (91) wrongful death or injury suits that have been
    dismissed or judgment entered in favor of the Company. 4. A new medical study conducted by the Hennepin County Medical
    Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota demonstrated that TASER devices
    have minimal physiological effect on humans in simulated arrest
    scenarios.  The study, ""Cataecholamines in Simulated Arrest
    Scenarios, was presented at the Australasia College of Emergency
    Medicine (ACEM) Winter Symposium 2009 in Darwin, Australia., ""These are exciting times for TASER International,"" said Rick Smith, CEO of TASER International. ""We are seeing the results of our heavy investments in research and development begin to transform the company from a product company to a full solutions provider. The integrated solution set of our TASER® devices, our new AXON on-officer Tactical Computer audio/video system, and EVIDENCE.COM digital evidence storage and collaboration solution are positioning the company for a new phase of growth potential."", ""We are now shipping the XREP wireless projectile, and we expect to begin shipments of the exciting new X3 in the third quarter. The X3 is our first multi-shot hand-held ECD and presents the opportunity for an upgrade cycle with our existing installed base, as well as appealing to new customers who may not have purchased previously due to the single shot limitations of prior technology. These four major product launches (X3, XREP, AXON and EVIDENCE.COM) could be transformative for the company as we move into the future,"" said Smith., More details concerning these new products are provided in the keynote address delivered by Rick and Tom Smith on July 27 at the annual TASER conference held in Fountain Hills, AZ. The keynote address can be seen at: www.TASER.com or www.TASERX3.com., The Company will host its second quarter 2009 earnings conference call on Wednesday, July 29, 2009 at 11:00 a.m. ET.

The pass code is 99668225 for both numbers., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's Statements of Operations presented in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance, specifically non-GAAP income from operations. In order for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods, we have shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our ""recurring core business operating results,"" meaning our operating performance excluding non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and other discrete charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity., About TASER International, Inc.

"The X3, which is capable of firing three cartridges without reloading, is the first new handheld ECD by TASER International since the introduction of the TASER® X26 ECD in 2003., The X3 uses a revolutionary Pulse Calibration System to constantly monitor and calibrate electrical output to provide more consistent effects on the target and to provide enhanced safety over the current proven and widely accepted TASER® technology., ""The TASER X3 is the most sophisticated handheld weapon ever developed,"" said Rick Smith, CEO of TASER International. ""The X3 will improve effectiveness and safety over the previous generations of TASER® devices while also providing the ability to store and retrieve more information and diagnostic analysis on the use and performance of the device than the X26. While our flagship TASER X26 is recognized as the leading law enforcement tool to deliver a less-lethal response to resistance, it is limited by being only a single-shot system. Developing a multiple-shot capability makes sense to increase officer safety through the ability to recover from a missed shot or even simultaneously stop up to three separate targets. The remarkable technology advances of the X3 will provide more safety for officers and the communities they protect as well as more transparency in reporting and analyzing dynamic confrontations with law enforcement."", Since July 1, TASER International has provided daily reveals of the new features and technology of the X3 at www.TASERX3.com. Several of the key technology breakthroughs noted in more detail at today's X3 unveiling include:, More information is available at: http://www.taser.com/COMPANY/PRESSROOM/Pages/default.aspx and www.TASERX3.com., The U.S. end user price of the full X3 system, which includes the Magnesium Holster and data download kit, is $1,799.95. The company will offer generous trade-in programs for both the X26 and ADVANCED TASER® M26 through December 31, 2009 to help our existing customers' transition to this groundbreaking new capability suite., About TASER International, Inc., TASER International's products protect life.

"The XREP is a wireless ECD capable of delivering the proven TASER Neuro Muscular Incapacitation effect to a maximum range of 100 feet, which is approximately twice the effective range of other 12-gauge less-lethal munitions options currently available on the market. There are two versions of the XREP -- the XREP RL, a ""Rifled"" round and the XREP FL, a ""Finned"" round. The XREP RL is specially designed for use with the TASER X12 LLS by Mossberg, utilizing a custom twist rifling optimized for low velocity rounds. The XREP FL is capable of being fired from any existing smooth bore 12-gauge pump-action shotgun., The X12 LLS is the world's first dedicated less-lethal 12-gauge pump-action shotgun that utilizes Radial Ammunition Key technology to only allow the firing of the TASER XREP R or other future less lethal rounds. The radial ammunition key prevents the firing of a regular lethal shotgun round., ""This is an exciting day for TASER International as we launch the first wireless TASER capability while breaking the limitations of range and accuracy of traditional 12 gauge impact rounds,"" said Rick Smith, CEO and founder of TASER International.

"The study was presented at the ACEM Winter Symposium 2009 by Dr. Donald M. Dawes, another author on the study and a member of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Louisville, Kentucky., According to the presentation, ""Some authors have opined that the temporal relationship between ECD use and ARDs [arrest-related deaths] may be related to acute stress cardiomyopathy induced by high circulating catecholamines, rather than an immediate electrical-induced arrhythmia. In this study, we compared the stress response during simulated use of force encounters."", For the study, sixty subjects performed one of the following five arrest-related scenarios:, 1) A 150-meter sprint, simulating flight from law enforcement
    officers,
 2) 45-seconds of hitting and kicking a heavy bag, simulating physical
    combat with officers,
 3) A 10-second TASER® X26 ECD exposure,
 4) A K-9 training exercise of approximately 30 seconds, or
 5) An Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.) spray exposure to the face., From the data obtained in the study, the researchers concluded that ""the ECD was one of the least activating of catecholamines while the simulated combat was one of the most activating. The simulated combat also lowered the pH the most of all the tasks."", ""Catecholamines are an indicator of the amount of adrenaline produced by the body in physical and stressful situations,"" stated Mark Kroll, PhD, Chairman of the TASER International Scientific and Medical Advisory Board. ""This study is one of the first to look at the human physiology in common arrest-related behaviors and police tools and tactics.

"TASER International, Inc. (Nasdaq:TASR), a leading provider of technology solutions and the market leader in electronic control devices (ECDs), commends the Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota for the groundbreaking study, Cataecholamines in Simulated Arrest Scenarios, which was presented this week at the Australasia College of Emergency Medicine (ACEM) Winter Symposium 2009 in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. The research led by Dr. Jeffrey D. Ho of the Department of Emergency Medicine, Hennepin County Medical Center, looked at the human physiology involved in common subject behavior, as well as police tools and tactics in arrest-related scenarios., The study was presented at the ACEM Winter Symposium 2009 by Dr. Donald M. Dawes, another author on the study and a member of the Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Louisville, Kentucky., According to the presentation, ""Some authors have opined that the temporal relationship between ECD use and ARDs [arrest-related deaths] may be related to acute stress cardiomyopathy induced by high circulating catecholamines, rather than an immediate electrical-induced arrhythmia. In this study, we compared the stress response during simulated use of force encounters."", For the study, sixty subjects performed one of the following five arrest-related scenarios:, 1) A 150-meter sprint, simulating flight from law enforcement
    officers, 
 2) 45-seconds of hitting and kicking a heavy bag, simulating physical
    combat with officers,
 3) A 10-second TASER® X26 ECD exposure,
 4) A K-9 training exercise of approximately 30 seconds, or
 5) An Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.) spray exposure to the face., From the data obtained in the study, the researchers concluded that ""the ECD was one of the least activating of catecholamines while the simulated combat was one of the most activating. The simulated combat also lowered the pH the most of all the tasks."", ""Catecholamines are the bodies 'hyper hormones' and include the well-known adrenaline. They are an indicator of the amount of stress felt by the body,"" stated Mark Kroll, PhD, FACC, Adjunct Professor of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Minnesota and Chairman of the TASER International Scientific and Medical Advisory Board. ""This study is one of the first to look at the human physiology in common arrest-related situations with various police tools and tactics. The research is groundbreaking in that it clearly shows that the use of a TASER device does not significantly lead to the increase of catecholamines in the human body. However struggling or running from police causes dramatic increases which can begin to cascade toward sudden death,"" added Kroll., The poster presentation of the study can be found at http://tiny.cc/Tak9e, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International's products Protect Life and Protect Truth.

"SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Oct 27, 2010 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- TASER International, Inc. (NASDAQ: TASR), today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2010., , Q3 2010 Financial Summary:, -- Net sales were $21.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of $2.2 million or 10% compared to the third quarter of 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by customer delay of several large international orders, which were originally expected to be completed during the third quarter. Prior year third quarter sales were reduced by $3.5 million of deferred revenue related to the TASER® X26™ Electronic Control Device (ECD) trade-in program introduced with the launch of the TASER® X3™ product., -- Gross margin declined to 49.4% in the third quarter of 2010, compared to 56.9% in the same period last year. The decline was attributed to a combination of reduced leverage on indirect manufacturing expenses due to the decrease in sales, as well as some inventory obsolescence and restructuring charges. Following the official launch of Evidence.com, data center operating and software maintenance costs are included in cost of sales, which reduced gross margin as a percent of sales by 8.7% (from 58.1% before data center operations and software maintenance to 49.4% net). The prior year gross margin was impacted by the deferral of X26 revenue relating to the X26 trade-in program associated with the launch of the X3., -- Sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $9.5 million in the third quarter of 2010 decreased 17.2%, or $2.0 million, compared to the third quarter of 2009, as the Company engaged in tighter cost-control measures., -- Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased $5.0 million to $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2010, a 75% decrease from the same period last year. The reduction is partially attributed to launch costs in the prior year for X3 and prototype costs for the AXON product. Additionally, the launch of Evidence.com resulted in the Company including $1.8 million of expenses in cost of products sold for ongoing delivery and maintenance of the product, which were previously included in R&D., -- Adjusted operating income, which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation charges and depreciation and amortization, was $2.3 million for the third quarter of 2010, a $1.7 million increase from adjusted operating income of $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2009. GAAP loss from operations was $0.7 million for the quarter, compared to a loss from operations of $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2009., -- Net loss for the third quarter of 2010 was $2.3 million, while net loss per share on a basic and diluted basis was $0.04. The net loss was impacted by a reduction in the effective tax rate which reduced the income tax benefit. The pre-tax loss from operations was $0.01, and the adjustment in income tax benefit generated a per share loss of $0.03., Significant events in the third quarter of 2010 included the following:, -- The Company recorded a significant order to ship 2,748 X26 ECDs to the Texas Department of Public Safety following the decision by the agency to issue TASER X26 ECDs to all of its state troopers., -- The Company recorded its first AXON/Evidence.com platform sale in Minnesota with Burnsville, MN electing to outfit its officers with the new product offering from TASER., -- The Company won a final injunction in its patent infringement case against Stinger Systems in its claim for literal infringement of the Company's shaped pulse waveform patent. The Court also entered an order for a final injunction that states, ""Stinger, together with its officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of this Final Injunction, are hereby restrained and enjoined, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Section 283 and Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, from making, using, offering to sell, or selling in or from the United States, or importing into the United States, the S-200 ECDs, either alone or in combination with any other product, and all other products that are only colorably different from the S-200 ECDs in the context of claims 2 or 40 of the '295 patent, whether individually or in combination with other products or as part of another product, and from otherwise infringing, contributing to the infringement of, or inducing others to infringe claims 2 or 40 of the '295 patent."" This final injunction runs until the expiration of the '295 patent (February 11, 2023) and also applies to a substantial portion of the components for the S-200 ECD. Copies of the Court's orders are publically available at www.pacer.gov., ""In light of the challenging economic environment, we are encouraged by our team's continued reduction in the fixed costs needed to run the business and the improvements in our cash earnings,"" commented Rick Smith, CEO of TASER International, Inc. ""Cost control measures have yielded significant reductions in operating expenses and solid gross margins in our core business. While the investment we have made in Evidence.com will adversely impact total gross margins for the next few quarters as we recognize additional costs of operating our data centers while we begin to scale revenues, we believe these investments will yield significant long term shareholder value. It is a very exciting time for us as we begin to ramp revenue in our AXON and Evidence.com products.

 TASER International, Inc. (NASDAQ: TASR), is sponsoring the planting of 3,000 trees through Arbor Day Foundation in recognition of the estimated 100,000 lives saved from death or serious personal injury by TASER® brand electronic control devices (ECDs) on Dec. 13, 19 years after the company was founded., By giving new life to its community, TASER seeks to represent how its life-saving ECDs have made a difference in both law enforcement officers' and citizens' lives since the first devices were deployed in 1994., TASER partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation because of the organization's ongoing dedication to fostering community health through planting and nurturing trees, while TASER is empowering people around the world to provide the best safety and security for their communities. TASER selected its donations to support domestic reforestation projects of greatest need in California and Florida (representing the U.S. from east to west), as well as an international reforestation project in Brazil'sAtlantic Forest (representing TASER's international presence)., Brothers Rick and Tom Smith founded TASER in September 1993 to create safer personal protection alternatives, while using technologies to maximize public safety and minimize the potential for misuse. Their inspiration followed the tragic deaths of Rick's two former high school football teammates who were murdered in a road rage incident. ""Tom and I knew we wanted to create technology that could significantly change our culture and be a positive disruptive force that could revolutionize both personal safety and law enforcement by preventing situations like this personal tragedy in the future,"" said CEO Rick Smith. ""We wanted to commemorate the preservation of life by partnering with a foundation that gives new life to our world's forests."", ""Undoubtedly our Saves Counter hitting the 100,000 milestone is a critical reminder to our employees and the brave men and women of law enforcement about the valuable work they do every day,"" said Rick Smith. ""The Saves Counter is linked not just to the math behind the estimate, but to videos and reports of the heroic efforts of law enforcement officers to save lives with ECDs. It is with sincere gratitude that we thank these brave men and women for the risks that they take every day to keep our communities safe."", Methodology and Background, TASER's ""Saves Counter"" tracks estimates of the number of people whose lives have been saved from potential death or serious injury using TASER® devices and the number of times law enforcement uses TASER ECDs in the field. The Saves Counter is posted on the home page of TASER.com., As of Sept. 30, 2012, TASER International has sold approximately 700,000 TASER ECDs in 107 countries to more than 16,800 law enforcement and military agencies. In addition, approximately 255,000 TASER ECDs have been sold to the general public. The milestone coincides with TASER's recent announcement that it reached a four-year high with earnings, seeing revenues up 18 percent to 28.8 million at the end of the third quarter., The Saves Counter was developed based on a statistical analysis of TASER usage patterns in the more than 16,800 agencies using TASER ECDs today.

"“All law enforcement agencies and, therefore, all law enforcement personnel have an ethical, legal and moral obligation to identify, collect and preserve the very best evidence of each and every encounter between a police officer and the public,” said Thomas Streicher, retired Chief of the Cincinnati Police Department.  “There is nothing more compelling, in terms of knowing the truth, than video immediately recorded during a rapidly, evolving event and as seen from the officer’s perspective., “The AXON Flex On-Officer Camera provides all law enforcement agencies with the capability to immediately develop and implement a system of enhanced accountability which previously had not been available in American policing or to any other police agency in the world.  Cincinnati PD tested the original AXON system during my tenure as chief, and we provided significant feedback which I am glad to see incorporated in the new second generation AXON Flex system.  In my opinion, this technology is now ready for widespread deployment within law enforcement, bringing a significantly advanced, powerful, and new capability to the public safety community,” concluded Streicher.
“We believe the AXON Flex systems can transform how evidence is collected and preserved, enabling a fresh approach to policing that will not only reduce costs, but can enable a new level of trust and transparency between the public safety community and society as a whole,” said Rick Smith, CEO and founder of TASER International.
 “The AXON Flex solution allows officers the flexibility to choose which mounting configuration that best suits their needs and unique circumstances, while EVIDENCE.com™ service continues to serve as the most powerful back-end solution available,” said Smith.  “Our technology can resolve issues of false complaints, improve officer training and provide communities enhanced transparency.  At less than one-third the cost of in-car video systems and through its ability to help reduce litigation costs, this system ultimately saves taxpayer dollars while also providing protection to officers,” concluded Smith.
TASER, the market leader in on-officer cameras with more than 55,000 video systems in the field, created the new AXON Flex point of view camera, a technological breakthrough in the world of on-officer video devices.  With multiple mounting options, including a seamless integration with Oakley, Inc.’s Flak Jacket® eyewear, AXON Flex systems are TASER's newest offering in the field of evidence-capturing technology, giving officers flexibility, simplicity and wearability.
To complement the camera solution, TASER provides EVIDENCE.com service, an industry-leading evidence management system.  The AXON Flex system offers maximum flexibility and can be configured to plug-and-play with EVIDENCE.com service, or for local download at agencies that elect to build and maintain local digital evidence management systems.

(NASDAQ: TASR), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter of 2011 ended December 31, 2011., Financial Summary:, Other significant events:, ""In 2011, we continued to enhance our market leading positions in defense hardware, software and services offerings through the successful launch and early adoption of our new X2 product, strong momentum in our AXON and EVIDENCE.com offering, and a continued focus on building stronger customer relationships,"" commented Rick Smith, CEO of TASER International, Inc., ""The early success of the X2 ECD product is not only the result of our continued focus on innovation, but also the ongoing efforts to collaborate with our customers while focusing on making strategically sound investments. Due to the success of the X2 and the demand we are seeing for the recently launched AXON Flex system, we have taken actions to better position the company for future financial success by rationalizing several legacy product lines. While this action resulted in a one-time charge during the fourth quarter, it allows us further flexibility to manage our business in-line with customer demand and continue to position TASER for growth., ""Looking to 2012, we will continue to focus on cost and maintaining a flexible balance sheet that allows us to shift with market conditions and capture growth from the continued increasing demand we see for our products.

The pass code is 60976219., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's Statements of Operations presented in accordance with GAAP, we are presenting non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. We have presented these measures for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods and have shown a reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures in the tables at the end of this release. These non-GAAP measures include the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, litigation judgment expense, asset impairment charges, loss on write down of Property and Equipment, and excess inventory charges associated with the TASER X3 ECD and first generation AXON Video product. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our ""recurring core business operating results,"" meaning our operating performance excluding non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and other discrete non-cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, As noted previously, these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the impact of other non-cash charges. Management believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release., About TASER International, Inc., TASER International, Inc.

TASER (NASDAQ: TASR) today announced that it was honored as one of the Best Medium-Sized Companies to Work For in 2014, a Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award. The Employees' Choice Awards rely solely on the input of employees, who elect to provide feedback on their jobs, work environments and companies via Glassdoor's anonymous online company review survey., ""This is quite an honor for TASER International and it's a testament that you can keep everyone excited about their jobs when your mission is saving lives,"" said winning company CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""A lot of people know us for our TASER Smart Weapons and technology but they may not know that we built the first major cloud computing platform called EVIDENCE.com that's sweeping through the law enforcement community as our second revolutionary new product. The quality of life is important here and we use technology to make a difference in the world. Our culture is fun and working in an open environment in our amazing building promotes a positive attitude. We try to attract the best and brightest that want the challenge to change lives and being honored on this list is a great start."", ""Glassdoor is working to create greater workplace transparency and is committed to helping people find jobs they love,"" said Glassdoor CEO and Co-founder Robert Hohman. ""Through the Employees' Choice Awards, we aim to highlight those employers that excel in keeping employees satisfied and engaged."", The Glassdoor company review survey includes both quantitative and qualitative questions designed to capture a genuine and authentic inside look at what it's like to work at particular jobs and companies. The survey asks employees to rate their satisfaction with the company overall, and key workplace factors like career opportunities, compensation and benefits, work/life balance, senior management, as well as culture and values. In addition, employees are asked to describe the best reasons to work at their company as well as any downsides., The Best Medium-Sized Companies to Work for List is determined using company reviews shared by U.S. based employees who elected to participate in the survey between November 14, 2012 and November 12, 2013.

These orders are expected to ship in the fourth quarter 2013., ""The AXON flex cameras have already proved beneficial in solving cases and exonerating the actions of officers,"" said Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith., Recent high-profile events affecting law enforcement agencies such as Sanford's bring to light the need for streamlined, transparent, and trustworthy evidence collection systems. A Cambridge University research study conducted in the Rialto Police Department (CA) demonstrated that the implementation of AXON on-officer cameras led to an 88% reduction in complaints against police officers and a 60% decline in use-of-force incidences., Sanford PD will seamlessly manage the digital evidence created by their AXON cameras with EVIDENCE.com.

TASER (NASDAQ: TASR) today announced new pricing for its AXON flex™ cameras and EVIDENCE.com service. AXON flex is now $499, down from $949 and EVIDENCE.com pricing has been made easier, and with lower price options, starting at only $9.95 per month. With customer-selectable tiers of EVIDENCE.com service, every agency has the flexibility to only pay for what they need. This allows agencies to fully 
control and predict costs in a manner to best fit their needs. The Leaders' Pricing Program includes special discounts that will last until June 30, 2014 to recognize those agencies that lead the adoption of this important new technology., In tight budgetary environment, the new AXON and EVIDENCE.com pricing addresses the primary challenges with enterprise cameras and software: affordability and predictability. As a result, important technology that is proven to reduce police complaints and use of force is now within reach of every agency., ""Every officer deserves protection and price should not be a barrier,"" said Jason Droege, President of EVIDENCE.com. ""The feedback from the launch of AXON body™ cameras at $299 was so overwhelmingly positive that we decided to make yet another disruptive move by reducing the price of our flagship AXON flex point-of-view system down to $499. Now all officers can afford the protection they deserve."", ""We know the powerful benefits of body worn cameras in policing: Research shows that having video can reduce police complaints by 90% and use of force incidents by 60%. Video and multi-media data are enormous tidal waves on the horizon that could overwhelm existing law enforcement technology infrastructures. Our solution, EVIDENCE.com, is a massively scalable cloud-based storage system designed to help law enforcement 
seamlessly capture and manage the deluge of multi-media evidence from the exploding array of mobile sensors, including our own AXON wearable cameras as well as mobile phones, digital cameras, or virtually any device which generates digital information,"" concluded Droege., EVIDENCE.com simplifies massive digital evidence management by allowing any agency to scale their capabilities without limits -- and without the purchase of hardware or software.

Halstead. ""This technology has the ability to document exactly what occurred, what was said, and has proven to clearly demonstrate the incident for the community. It has been my experience when the incident is viewed by those affected by our actions, they experience the incident from the officer's perspective -- something that has been missing in our profession until now."", ""With this large followup order by the Fort Worth Police Department combined with the DFW International Airport Department of Public Safety's initial order of AXON flex cameras, this major metropolitan area is leading what we believe is the next major wave in public safety,"" said Rick Smith, CEO and founder of TASER. ""Many thought leaders in law enforcement are telling us they see on-officer video will become standard equipment within the next 5-10 years. We believe on-officer video will have a significant positive impact on law enforcement similar in scope to the impact of TASER weapons in the early 2000s., ""Across the country, agencies that deploy TASER Flex on-officer cameras have also seen reduction in use of force and reduction in complaints. The on-officer camera studies have proven the benefits of on-officer video. Our law enforcement partners have also deployed TASER's cloud-based EVIDENCE.com system that offers the most cost-effective method of implementing their program. We developed EVIDENCE.com to provide police agencies with a secure, cost effective data vault that allows their officers to focus on policing, minimizing their time worrying about the technical complexities of data management,""

 TASER (NASDAQ: TASR) today announced that the Truckee Police Department is deploying 28 AXON Flex™ on-officer cameras with five years of EVIDENCE.com service to all of its patrol officers. The acquisition includes both the EVIDENCE.com service and the TASER Assurance Plan (TAP)., The TAP is a warranty/replacement program that allows the agency to maintain its current Flex program worry free with our world-class service program and integrating warranty coverage including on-site spare equipment so officers experience zero downtime. It also replaces an agency's entire inventory of covered equipment after the fifth year., The TAP allows agencies like Truckee to reach full deployment with full protection over the program's service life, while making five low annual payments. This effort reinforces TASER's commitment to helping agencies upgrade outdated technology while staying within limited capital budgets., ""We are pleased to be moving away from our fixed in car cameras to the AXON on-officer system,"" said Truckee Police Chief Adam McGill.

 Rick Smith, Founder & CEO of TASER International, Inc. (NASDAQ: TASR), today issued the following letter to shareholders:, To All TASER Shareholders,, It's been a little over a year since we introduced the AXON Flex™ camera system with EVIDENCE.com, a new and significant growth opportunity for TASER. This new technology is enabling us to expand our presence in a $10 to $20 billion dollar annual market for public safety technology for which we are uniquely positioned due to our relationship with more than 16,000 U.S. law enforcement agencies. I also want to share some insights from our Analyst Day hosted at NASDAQ in New York last month as many of you could not attend in person., This week, the New York Times reported on a groundbreaking study from the Rialto (CA) Police Department and Cambridge University (UK) examining the effects of on-officer cameras, using our AXON Flex on-officer camera system. Employing a carefully controlled study design, the investigators demonstrated dramatic reductions in both citizen complaints against police (down 87.5%), and incidents involving the use of force (which were reduced by 59%). The Rialto study utilized a rigorous, prospective and randomized study design. Its results are further supported by results reported less formally from other agencies across the 
U.S., This new data provides compelling evidence that the AXON Flex on-officer video system is fast becoming a proven capability to reduce our customers' substantial legal costs. According the a study by the Associated Press, U.S. law enforcement agencies spend an average of more than $2,500 per officer per year in payouts to settle claims against the agency -- which aggregates to well over $2 billion annually for agencies across the U.S., We see several similarities to our market entry with TASER® weapons over a decade ago when looking at the video market. When we launched the TASER M26™ in late 1999, there was widespread skepticism about electrical weapons. There were two factors that overcame this skepticism. The first factor was the emergence of statistics showing that the deployment of TASER M26 devices was yielding significant and measurable reductions in injuries to both officers and suspects, as well as reductions in deaths during use-of-force incidents. This data was used to show that the cost savings from deploying TASER weapons yielded a significant and positive return on investment for the agency., The second factor that overcame early TASER weapons skepticism was the personal experience of officers in the field. One officer, from Washington State, initially expressed that he had ""zero"" interest in using a TASER weapon. However, after just a few weeks in the field with a TASER M26, he was able to safely end dangerous situations where he would previously have had to place his personal safety at risk and potentially cause significant harm to the subject. In a later e-mail I recall him writing, ""They can pry my TASER from my cold dead fingers!"", We are now seeing these same two factors emerge in the on-officer video space. In addition to the statistics shown above, which demonstrate that our video solutions yield substantial reductions in major cost areas, we now regularly hear from officers who tell us they do not want to go on duty without their AXON Flex camera. This feeling is compounded after the officer experiences a complaint that is quickly resolved due to the video. You can hear it from the officer in their own words in the video on our AXON Flex web page at http://www.taser.com/products/on-officer-video/axon-flex-on-officer-video, We have invested significant resources since 2008 to build our AXON Flex and EVIDENCE.com ecosystem. Fortunately, we have built a sound company that has enabled us to make these investments, while simultaneously returning over $52 million in cash to shareholders via share repurchases (with another $25 million share buyback currently in-process). All of these investments and cash returns have been funded by cash flow from the business., We have set out on a mission to build technologies that make the world safer. We knew in our hearts that enabling public safety officers to record video events of encounters would greatly reduce the controversies surrounding police work -- thereby reducing citizen complaints, litigation and the associated financial costs. However, even we were surprised to see just how significantly these new video capabilities altered the outcomes of these incidents themselves -- deterring aberrant behavior such that the frequency of incidents escalating to violence has dropped dramatically where the AXON on-officer video system is employed., At our Analyst Day in New York last month, we laid out our Public Safety Platform Strategy and a vision for how we can grow the company over the next 3-5 years. Our most valuable asset doesn't come from any one product, or even our intellectual property portfolio of the more than 100 patents we hold for our core Conducted Electrical Weapon technology., Our most valuable asset is the strong brand relationship that we have built with more than 16,000 law enforcement agencies around the world., We realized our expertise is more than just making electrical weapons. Our most valuable expertise is in how to take advanced technology, make it reliable and easy to use for our core market, and deliver it with the training and support services to enable practical solutions for our public safety customers., The last company to revolutionize law enforcement was TASER International. Through our TASER weapons, which are now deployed by more than 90% of U.S. law enforcement agencies, we have fundamentally changed policing and saved more than 100,000 lives from potential death or serious injury., The next company to revolutionize law enforcement will be TASER International. Our new AXON Flex & EVIDENCE.com platform will change the way police agencies interact with their broader communities. These smart devices, cloud hosted software, training and support services create a Public Safety Platform that will enable our customers to rapidly deploy new technologies, with minimal technical expertise required on their parts., We believe that digital video and multi-media will become the centerpiece of law enforcement records in the future. We are building a platform that has the potential to dramatically improve the security, efficiency and quality of those records., We estimate our public safety customers spend between $10 and $20 billion on technology each year in the U.S. alone. The global annual market is likely five to ten times larger. Our customers in the U.S. spend more than $2 billion each year on settlements for legal complaints filed against their agencies. The data from Rialto and other agencies show our solutions can dramatically reduce those expenditures., At our Analyst Day, we presented models showing that, with reasonable assumptions we believe we can grow TASER to between $166 million and $303 million in revenue over the next three to five years. None of these models assume the kind of rapid adoption we saw with TASER weapons in the early 2000's., We believe we have positioned TASER International to deliver an end-to-end solution that brings capabilities our customers have never seen before, using a new technology delivery model that enables us to innovate faster, thereby accelerating our customers' ability to deploy the leading edge technology required to protect society in a fast changing world., We solve big, important problems for our customers, creating significant value for all our stakeholders, including our customers, our employees, our shareholders and society at large. Solving big problems is neither easy nor quick. We've done this before, in this market, with these same customers.

 The Rialto Police Department released today the results of a 12-month controlled, randomized study on the impact of on-officer video cameras, specifically utilizing the AXON Flex™ system from TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR)., The full study, titled ""The Rialto Police Departments Body-Worn Video Camera Experiment,"" began on February 13, 2012 and ran for a full 12-month period. The experimental procedure included random assignment of all police shifts to either experimental (with camera) or control (without camera) conditions. Shifts were randomly allocated to treatment and control conditions, using the Cambridge Randomizer®, on a weekly basis., Key Findings:, To ensure security of all data gathered, officers' videos were automatically-uploaded at the end of each shift to EVIDENCE.com, and the research team was granted full access to this rich data, encompassing over 50,000 hours of police-public interactions., ""These results carry significant implications for the future of the law enforcement profession,"" said Chief Tony Farrar, the principle investigator who led the study as his graduate degree thesis at Cambridge University. ""The use of body-worn video had a dramatic impact on reducing both the controversy associated with complaints and the risk of injuries associated with use-of-force incidents. The next phase of our study is to quantify and analyse the financial impact associated with these significant reductions in both legal and physical risks."", At the conclusion of the experimental period, the Rialto Police Department implemented a 3-year EVIDENCE.com service plan and integrated AXON Flex video cameras into standard operations going forward., ""Across the country, agencies that deploy TASER Flex on-officer cameras have also seen reduction in use of force and reduction in complaints,"" said Jason Droege, general manager of EVIDENCE.com. ""Rialto has been a thought leader: this rigorous study scientifically proves the benefits of on-officer video. They also deployed TASER's cloud-based EVIDENCE.com system that offered the most cost-effective method of implementing their program. We developed EVIDENCE.com to provide police agencies with a secure, cost effective data vault that allows their officers to focus on policing, minimizing their time worrying about the technical complexities of data management."", About The Rialto Police Department and Chief Tony Farrar, The Rialto Police Department is the police department for the city of Rialto, CA. The agency has 115 sworn officers and 42 non-sworn personnel that cover an area of over 22 square miles and a population of 99,171. Chief Farrar, a police officer for more than 30 years holds graduate degrees in Administration of Justice and Business Administration, and a bachelor's degree in Police Science. He is currently attending Cambridge University (UK) - Institute of Criminology pursuing an additional graduate degree in Criminology.

 TASER (NASDAQ: TASR) today announced a significant TASER® X2™ Conducted Energy Weapons (CEWs) and AXONFlex on-officer camera order using the new TASER Protection Plan (TPP) and TASER Assurance Plan (TAP) by Lake Havasu Police Department (AZ). This is a full deployment of 92 X2s for all of its sworn and detention officers and 58 AXONFlex cameras for 58 sworn field personnel. The order to bring them to full deployment status was received in the fourth quarter of 2012 and is anticipated to ship in the 1st quarter of 2013., The Lake Havasu Police Department is the first law enforcement agency to fully deploy both the new X2 and AXONFlex technology to its agency using the unique TAP and TPP options., The TPP payment program allows agencies to pay for equipment over a 5-year program, allowing customers to budget more predictably and support full deployment of our latest technology. It provides for budget certainty, upgrades technology without the time constraints associated with capital acquisitions, locks in current pricing, and conserves capital., The TAP is a warranty/replacement program that allows the agency to maintain its current X2/Flex program worry free with a no questions asked warranty including on-site spare equipment so officers experience zero downtime. It also refreshes an agency's entire arsenal of related equipment after the fifth year., The TPP/TAP combination (the first program of its kind) allows agencies like Lake Havasu to go full deployment with full protection over the program's service life, while making five low annual payments. This effort reinforces TASER's commitment to helping agencies upgrade outdated technology while staying within limited capital budgets., ""One of the most exciting aspects of this new program was that it was outlined and proposed by our customers at Lake Havasu,"" said Rick Smith, CEO and founder of TASER.

Specifically, AXON Flex cameras with AXON Signal technology will be available in Q1 2015., The AXON Signal camera technology will enable cameras to automatically start recording when an officer's light bar is turned on or when a TASER Smart weapon is powered on. All enabled AXON Signal cameras within range will receive status from the light bar or smart weapon and start recording. This feature will offer multiple angles to be captured from different perspectives if more than one AXON Flex camera is on scene., ""We are committed to listening to our customers to understand what features will help them do their jobs better and we are proud to announce the AXON Signal technology as a result of that feedback,"" said Rick Smith, founder and CEO, TASER International.

 EVIDENCE.com, a business unit of TASER International, (NASDAQ: TASR) has been selected by the LondonMetropolitan Police Service (MPS) to provide another 500 AXON cameras as part of the ongoing pilot led by the Mayor's Office of Policing and Crime (MOPAC). The evidence collected from the cameras will continue to be securely stored and managed through the EVIDENCE.com platform., As previously announced by the Company on an 8K filed on August 27, 2014, the London Met is expanding their 18-month pilot with an additional 500 cameras.

This will be the largest body-worn camera pilot program of AXON cameras in the world with 1,000 units deployed., During the pilot program, MOPAC and the College of Policing will assess a number of outcomes including; criminal justice outcomes, complaints against police, use of force by police, amount of time saved in administration tasks and the impact on public confidence through the use of cameras., ""As one of the leading and most respected police agencies in the world, we believe the results from the London Met pilot will help shape future body-worn camera programs as the technology is adopted in more international markets,"" said Jeff Kukowski, Chief Operating Officer of TASER International. ""Our AXON cameras coupled with the EVIDENCE.com platform are a game-changer for law enforcement as they increase transparency, save taxpayer dollars and ultimately help make communities safer."", Metropolitan Police Service Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley who oversees the MPS pilot said: ""Body-worn video is already proving its value to policing in London. Daily we hear of incidents where the presence of the camera has provided additional evidence towards solving a crime or has validated an officer's account of what has happened."", These new cameras will be deployed to uniformed firearms officers and to members of the Territorial Support Group among others to further the scope of the pilot and extend the opportunity for officers to assess their value., TASER's AXON flex and AXON body cameras are small, yet highly visible, and can be attached securely to sunglasses, a cap, a shirt collar, shirt, or a head mount.

""When you pair this technology with our digital evidence management platform you enable secure and reliable evidence handling through the complete chain-of-custody."", TASER's AXON cameras are small, yet highly visible, and powered by a pocketsize battery pack which can be attached securely to sunglasses, a cap, a shirt collar, or a head mount. When recording, the cameras capture a wide-angle, full-color view of what an officer is facing. The video automatically uploads to EVIDENCE.com, a cloud-based storage and management system, where it can be easily accessed for review. An end-user cannot tamper with video files stored online or on AXON video camera., EVIDENCE.com helps police capture, manage, and share their digital evidence without the complexity or cost of installing in-house servers. It enables greater transparency through seamless integration with the industry-leading AXON body-worn video cameras. EVIDENCE.com is the most secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing all types of digital evidence. EVIDENCE.com automates the upload process to ensure security and integrity while keeping officers in the field rather than sitting at computers., A year-long Cambridge University study conducted at the Rialto, CA Police Department investigated whether officers' use of video cameras could bring measurable benefits to relations between police and civilians. The results showed an 88% reduction in citizen complaints and a 60% reduction in uses of force after implementation of TASER's AXON flex cameras., Follow EVIDENCE.com, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

bookings will not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings. Some bookings will be invoiced in subsequent years., CONTACT: Dan Behrendt

 Recognizing that law enforcement agencies often rely on manual practices to transfer sensitive electronic evidence -- including videos, photos and audio recordings -- to district attorneys (DAs) and other outside parties, EVIDENCE.com, a business unit of TASER (NASDAQ: TASR) today unveiled EVIDENCE.com External Sharing, a new technology built specifically so digital evidence can be securely and instantaneously shared., Today's announcement means law enforcement can now log into EVIDENCE.com and email secure links that allow DAs, the media or others to access specific files to create virtual evidence rooms. The process is similar to sharing files through widely used consumer cloud-based storage systems like Dropbox, but with powerful security protections incorporated., ""The ability to share evidentiary video through EVIDENCE.com External Sharing to the Commonwealth Attorney has proven invaluable for our agency,"" said Detective Melissa Clemens from the Newport News Police Department, one of the beta testing agencies during the past several months. ""Because we no longer need to burn disks and devote officer time to transporting them around, we can re-focus those resources on other pressing police work. Most importantly, using this new technology has increased the number of cases that end in plea deals. This reduces our officers' time in court since we can get the evidence in front of the prosecutors immediately."", ""This new functionality modernizes a time and money wasting process, by erasing inefficiencies and giving time back to officers so they can focus on actual police work, not administrative activities,"" said Jason Droege, President of EVIDENCE.com., In addition to leveraging the cloud for its secure data center, EVIDENCE.com draws on wearable technology and smart-phone applications for its arsenal of digital-evidence collection and management tools available to law enforcement., AXON body worn video cameras allow officers to easily capture video evidence that then seamlessly uploads to their agencies' EVIDENCE.com account. Additionally, EVIDENCE Mobile™, a free application supported on iOS™ and Android™, turns officers' smart phones into user-friendly, evidence-capturing devices, with secure photo, video and audio-recording capabilities., ""While law enforcement agencies collect and manage growing amounts of digital evidence each year, very little technological innovation has come forward to address this pressing need,"" said Droege. ""EVIDENCE.com is the only technology transforming the way digital evidence is collected and handled. Ultimately we want to save agencies time and money, increase transparency with the public, and help solve more crimes."", For a demo of EVIDENCE.com External Sharing visit: http://www.taser.com/external-sharing., About EVIDENCE.com, EVIDENCE.com helps public safety agencies capture, manage, and share their digital evidence without the complexity or cost of installing in-house servers. It enables greater transparency through seamless integration with the industry-leading AXON® on-officer cameras., EVIDENCE.com is the most secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing all types of digital evidence. EVIDENCE.com automates the upload process to ensure security and integrity while keeping officers in the field rather than sitting computers. The evidence can then be tagged, copied, and shared within a secure environment providing full chain-of-custody tracking, audit trail accountability, and role-based security access protocols. EVIDENCE.com enables multiple officers on different devices and at different agencies to collaborate, build a complete case, and securely share the whole incident with the right people in minutes., EVIDENCE.com is a business unit of TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR) and is headquartered in Seattle, WA with offices in Scottsdale, AZ and Santa Barbara, CA., Follow EVIDENCE.com, About TASER International, Inc.TASER protects life: TASER Conducted Electrical Weapons (CEWs) have saved more than 120,000 lives from potential death or serious injury.

/*--><!]]>*/, SEATTLE, Oct. 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International, Inc. (NASDAQ: TASR), the global leader in cloud-based digital evidence management and body-worn video, today announced its disruptive entry into the in-car video market with Axon Fleet. This breakthrough 
in-car video system offers advanced functionality at an unheard-of price of $499, which includes two cameras for the front window and rear seat area. Axon Fleet will be available for pre-orders starting this week and available for shipment in Q1 2016., Designed with connectivity in mind, Axon Fleet incorporates Axon Signal technology to automatically activate during critical situations.  In addition, Wi-Fi connectivity connects the infinite computing power of the cloud with Evidence.com, enabling future capabilities never before possible in the car., The new offering also boasts a wide-angle lens and HD video, a flexible design that allows for quick and straightforward camera swaps, a rear-facing camera, and a pre-event buffer for up to two minutes. Priced at only $499 per vehicle, Axon Fleet brings a simple user experience and unprecedented connectivity at a cost 90% lower than that of traditional in-car systems., ""We're bringing industry-leading technology to the in-car video market and offering it at an epic price,"" says Rick Smith, CEO and Founder of TASER. ""We are delighted to bring the power of the cloud to the patrol car.  Not only is the price of the hardware dramatically lower than existing solutions, but with our Fleet Unlimited Plan, agencies can deploy the cameras with unlimited HD Evidence.com data management and secure storage for just $39 per month with our leaders' pricing program. Agencies can buy Axon Fleet and unlimited data storage for about half the cost of just the hardware of a typical in-car video system."", ""Even in the few months that we've been testing Axon Fleet, the advantages are clear,"" says Sgt. Bill Kuykendall from the Buda Police Department in Texas. ""We've gained a huge amount of space back in the patrol unit, with much better capabilities, all at a massive savings.

TASER's metamorphosis to the Axon software platform with multiple hardware extensions provides a unified law enforcement customer experience similar to what consumers see today with the Apple ecosystem. This lays the foundation for tremendous growth and is the beginning of an incredible story."", TASER will showcase Axon Fleet at this year's International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference in Chicago, IL.

This order was received in the third quarter of 2015 and is expected to ship in the third and fourth quarter of 2015., ""We're currently in a climate where what we do as law enforcement officers is increasingly put under a microscope,"" says Police Director Toney Armstrong. ""The body cameras will not only help capture a thorough record of every police incident, but it will also help foster a relationship with our community built on trust and accountability."", ""If our Axon cameras were a revolution in police technology, Axon Signal is this technology's newest evolution. By programming our cameras to turn on automatically, we reduce the possibility for user error, which helps to ensure the sorts of overwhelmingly positive results we've seen in dozens of agencies across the country,"" says TASER Founder and CEO Rick Smith. ""We couldn't be more thrilled to be offering this new technology, and we are extremely excited to see major agencies like the Memphis PD beginning to adopt it."", About Axon Signal:, Our Axon Signal technology integrates with TASER's increasingly iconic Axon Flex body-worn camera, offering automatic activation integrated with TASER's SmartWeapons and light bar. Axon Signal will activate all enabled cameras within range to ensure events are not missed and multiple perspectives are captured, thereby reducing the potential for user error and bolstering the overall effects of the cameras. Axon Signal has already been adopted by a number of agencies, including Mobile, AL and Lakeway, TX. Learn more here: www.Axon.io/signal., TASER's Axon cameras are small, yet highly visible, and can be attached securely to sunglasses, a cap, a shirt collar, or a head mount. They are powered by a pocket-sized battery pack, which ensures recording capability during an entire shift. When recording, the cameras capture a wide-angle, full-color view of what an officer is facing. The video automatically uploads via a docking station to Evidence.com, a cloud-based storage and management system, where it can be easily accessed for review. The video files stored online or on the Axon video camera are secure and cannot be tampered with., Evidence.com helps law enforcement capture, manage, and share their digital evidence without the complexity or cost of installing in-house servers. It enables greater transparency through seamless integration with the industry-leading Axon body-worn video cameras. Evidence.com is the most secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing all types of digital evidence. Evidence.com automates the upload process to ensure security and integrity while keeping officers in the field rather than sitting at computers., There have been several studies conducted recently on the positive effects body-worn cameras can have on a police force and community.

/*--><!]]>*/, SEATTLE, Aug. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR) today announced large orders of its Axon body-worn video cameras and Evidence.com solution, a back-end digital evidence management system. These orders were received in the third quarter and will be shipped in the third and fourth quarter of 2015., Large orders were received from the following domestic agencies:, TASER's Axon body-worn cameras are small, yet highly visible, and can be attached securely to sunglasses, a cap, a shirt collar, or a head mount. They are powered by a pocket-sized battery pack, which ensures recording capability during an entire shift. When recording, the cameras capture a wide-angle, full-color view of what an officer is facing. The video automatically uploads via a docking station to Evidence.com, a cloud-based storage and management system, where it can be easily accessed for review. The video files stored online or on the Axon video camera are secure and cannot be tampered with., Evidence.com helps law enforcement capture, manage, and share their digital evidence without the complexity or cost of installing in-house servers. It enables greater transparency through seamless integration with the industry-leading Axon body-worn video cameras. Evidence.com is the most secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing all types of digital evidence. Evidence.com automates the upload process to ensure security and integrity while keeping officers in the field rather than sitting at computers., There have been several studies conducted recently on the positive effects body-worn cameras can have on a police force and community. These studies include a year-long Cambridge University study conducted at the Rialto, CA Police Department that showed an 88% reduction in citizen complaints and a 60% reduction in uses of force after implementation of TASER's Axon flex cameras. The San Diego Police Department also released a report showing the use of Axon body-worn cameras resulted in a 41% 
drop in complaints, 60% drop in total allegations and a 47% decline in ""personal body"" force by officers. The use of pepper spray was also reduced by 31%. In a study by Arizona State University, the Mesa Police Department's use of Axon cameras revealed a 48% reduction in citizen complaints against camera officers for misconduct during the study period, and a 75% decline in use of force complaints., Follow the TASER and Axon brand here:, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

""We're honored to have the opportunity to work with members of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, like Montgomery County, who are thought leaders in public safety and driving positive change for safer communities."", Large orders were received from the following domestic agencies:, TASER's Axon cameras are small, yet highly visible, and can be attached securely to sunglasses, a cap, a shirt collar, or a head mount. They are powered by a pocket-sized battery pack, which ensures recording capability during an entire shift. When recording, the cameras capture a wide-angle, full-color view of what an officer is facing. The video automatically uploads via a docking station to Evidence.com, a cloud-based storage and management system, where it can be easily accessed for review. The video files stored online or on the Axon video camera are secure and cannot be tampered with., Evidence.com helps law enforcement capture, manage, and share their digital evidence without the complexity or cost of installing in-house servers. It enables greater transparency through seamless integration with the industry-leading Axon body-worn video cameras. Evidence.com is the most secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing all types of digital evidence. Evidence.com automates the upload process to ensure security and integrity while keeping officers in the field rather than sitting at computers., There have been several studies conducted recently on the positive effects body-worn cameras can have on a police force and community. These studies include a year-long Cambridge University study conducted at the Rialto, CA Police Department that showed an 88% reduction in citizen complaints and a 60% reduction in uses of force after implementation of TASER's Axon flex cameras. The San Diego Police Department also released a report showing the use of Axon body-worn cameras resulted in a 41% drop in complaints, 60% drop in total allegations and a 47% decline in ""personal body"" force by officers. The 
use of pepper spray was also reduced by 31%. In a study by Arizona State University, the Mesa Police Department's use of Axon cameras revealed a 48% reduction in citizen complaints against camera officers for misconduct during the study period, and a 75% decline in use of force complaints., Follow the TASER and Axon brand here:, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

/*--><!]]>*/, SEATTLE, July 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR) announces Evidence.com for prosecutors, a new platform that enables prosecutors to manage any type of digital evidence shared from their law enforcement partners for free on a Standard License. The First Circuit of Florida State Attorney's Office has signed a five year contract for 250 prosecutor licenses, which will allow them to better manage the tidal wave of digital evidence that is being generated from police body cameras and other digital devices., Through early trials, more than 7 terabytes of data from more than 8,000 cases have been shared between prosecutors and local police agencies on the Evidence.com platform. With the Standard Prosecutor License prosecutors receive free unlimited data storage for all evidence shared with them, which allows jurisdictions to experience the full benefits of body-worn video while minimizing the technical challenges posed by new forms of evidence. In addition to receiving digital evidence from law enforcement, prosecutors will be able to electronically provide discovery and enact their own retention policies and audit controls. Available for $39 per user per month, prosecutors can purchase a Pro License, which unlocks premium features like 
redaction, advanced reporting, and other enterprise features., ""Prosecutors are increasingly faced with a flood of digital evidence that needs to be managed from capture to courtroom as more police departments adopt body cameras,"" says Marcus Womack, General Manager of TASER's Axon business. ""The solution we've created for Evidence.com is uniquely positioned to facilitate collaboration between government agencies and District Attorneys' Offices and ultimately make the discovery process more efficient and secure."", A recent study conducted in Newport News, Virginia found that the combination of Axon cameras and Evidence.com could have profound effects on the efficacy and efficiency of attempts to prosecute wrongdoers.  Specifically, the study found that, when video evidence was available, the percentage of guilty pleas entered in DUI cases rose from 70% to 89%.  The study estimated that each additional guilty plea saved officers a total of more than three hours of court time, thereby saving the taxpayers significant sums of money.  Moreover, nearly a third of guilty pleas were entered prior to the defendant's 
scheduled court date, thereby relieving officers of the need to appear in court at all.  Prosecutors at the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office identified video evidence as an important factor in 70% of DUI cases., Follow the TASER and Axon brand here:, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 19, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR), the global leader in cloud-based digital evidence management and body-worn video, today announced the second annual RISE Award winners in partnership with PoliceOne.com. The RISE Awards seek to honor those in law enforcement and in communities who save lives, lead by example, and find innovative solutions to pressing problems. The winners are as follows:, Winners were chosen from more than 200 nominees and represent an ideal of policing to which officers and agencies across the country can aspire. Law enforcement winners will each receive a $5,000 Axon technology grant to be put towards Axon body cameras or EVIDENCE.com, a one year subscription to PoliceOnce Academy, and VIP tickets to this year's IACP conference in Chicago. Community Leadership winners will each receive a $5,000 community-building donation., ""The RISE Awards were created to recognize the everyday heroes who rise to the challenges of serving our communities with courage and strength every day,"" said Rick Smith, Founder and CEO of TASER. ""This year's awards yielded stories of unparalleled valor and professionalism and put a spotlight on the way community organizations play an important role in fulfilling the mission of building safer communities."", About the Winners, Corporal Les Munn earned the Protect Life Award for risking his own safety, on more than one occasion, to save the life of a community member. On January 15th 2014 Cpl. Munn used his training as an Emergency Medical Technician to keep the victim of a recent shooting alive despite heavy bleeding and a collapsed lung until the Life Net arrived. A second occasion for heroism arose in March of that year, in which Munn, responding to a vehicle crash, aided the breathing of a badly injured man trapped in his vehicle, thereby saving his life., Sergeant Felicia Pecora earned the Law Enforcement Leadership award for demonstrating extraordinary leadership in her community. Having noticed a significant spike in violent and gang-related crime in her area, Pecora sought out its root causes. When she found that many of the effected areas were plagued with substandard school systems, she worked in tandem with the local library to offer resources for school children to remedy and reverse the ill-effects of a poor education., The Redlands Police Department earned the Agency of the Year award for implementing creative, technological solutions to significant law-enforcement problems. In a year that saw both a dramatic reduction in the force's budget and a dramatic uptick in crime (particularly vehicle break-ins), RPD undertook a new program whereby they planted laptops equipped with GPS tracking devices in unattended vehicles. Once successful arrests for vehicle break-ins became more common (thanks to the tracking devices), the program acted as a sufficient deterrent to reduce break-ins by nearly 20% over the course of three years., Blue Line K9 Foundation, founded by Officer Wes Zygmont after an incident in which he was badly injured and his canine partner was killed, earned a Community Leadership award for providing assistance to police K9 handlers and their families in the event of a fallen or injured K9 or K9 handler in the line of duty. Blue Line K9 also provides financial assistance to handlers to cover or offset the costs of K9 training and equipment., The Prescott Valley Police Foundation earned a Community Leadership award for their commitment to ending domestic violence and supporting victims of crimes in their community through the work of their Yavapai County Coordinated Community Response Team. By hosting a number of events each year, they are able to act as a resource for victims and the community at large., Ada T Payne Friends of the Urban Libraries earned a Community Leadership award by working with libraries and law enforcement alike to provide mentorship and education for urban students whose schools may be failing. By offering a six-week reading, science, and art course as well as hands-on mentorship by police officers, they have taken great strides toward promoting literacy and education among at-risk children., About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies. Founded in 1993, TASER first transformed law enforcement with its electrical weapons. TASER continues to define smarter policing with its growing suite of technology solutions, including AXON body-worn video cameras and EVIDENCE.com, a secure digital evidence management platform.

will be provided.  Some bookings might be invoiced in subsequent years., Due to municipal government funding rules, certain of the future year amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses.  Although TASER has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be completed, if agencies do not appropriate money in future year budgets or invoke a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings will not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., TASER INTERNATIONAL, INC., UNIT SALES STATISTICS, (Unaudited), Units and

/*--><!]]>*/, SEATTLE, Feb. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR) today announced the purchase of 700 AXON Flex body cameras as well as 700 five-year Unlimited and RMS Integration licenses to EVIDENCE.com by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. This order was received in the first quarter of 2015 and is expected to ship in the first 
quarter of 2015., ""My Office has used TASER products for years in both detention and law enforcement applications.  I am extremely satisfied with the quality of the TASER products and the customer service that comes with them,"" said Sheriff Joe Arpaio.  ""TASER continues to impress me with their ability to stay on top of technology in the creation of effective tools that can be used in law enforcement applications. The 700 AXON body-worn camera systems that we are purchasing will be a welcomed addition to my office and our fight against crime,"" concluded Sheriff Arpaio., The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office selected the Unlimited and RMS Integration Plan on EVIDENCE.com to maximize budget predictability and minimize total cost across their body worn video program.  The Unlimited Plan includes all of the advanced features of EVIDENCE.com, unlimited storage, and a service plan that includes automatic upgrades of AXON cameras every 2.5 years.  The RMS Integration Plan links their Records Management System with their AXON 
videos on EVIDENCE.com.  Integrating RMS systems with EVIDENCE.com automates the process of tagging videos with complete, correct metadata that results in greater accuracy and increased efficiency., About the Unlimited Plan:, The Unlimited Plan on EVIDENCE.com offers unlimited storage for data uploaded from AXON cameras and EVIDENCE Mobile as well the added benefit of an agency being able to upgrade their AXON cameras every 2.5 years.  The Unlimited Plan costs $79 per user per month and is offered with a three to five-year contract.  The Unlimited Plan entitles the user to the following:, About the RMS Integration Plan:, The RMS Integration Plan from EVIDENCE.com takes information exported from the agency's Record Management System and correlates it with videos on EVIDENCE.com. An agency's AXON videos are then automatically tagged with the correct metadata including, Incident ID, Category and Location. Officers are no longer required to spend valuable time entering this data after each incident, and supervisors no longer have to search extensively for untagged or incorrectly tagged videos.  Benefits to this plan include:, About AXON Cameras, TASER's AXON cameras are small, yet highly visible, and can be attached securely to sunglasses, a cap, a shirt collar, or a head mount.  They are powered by a pocket-sized battery pack, which ensures recording capability during an entire shift. When recording, the cameras capture a wide-angle, full-color view of what an officer is facing.  The video automatically uploads via a docking station to EVIDENCE.com, a cloud-based storage and management system, where it can be easily accessed for review.  The video files stored online or on the AXON video camera are secure and cannot be tampered with., About EVIDENCE.com, EVIDENCE.com helps police capture, manage, and share their digital evidence without the complexity or cost of installing in-house servers.  It enables greater transparency through seamless integration with the industry-leading AXON body-worn video cameras.  EVIDENCE.com is the most secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for managing all types of digital evidence. EVIDENCE.com automates the upload process to ensure security and integrity while keeping officers in the field rather than sitting at computers., A year-long Cambridge University study conducted at the Rialto, CA Police Department investigated whether officers' use of video cameras could bring measurable benefits to relations between police and civilians.  The results showed an 88% reduction in citizen complaints and a 60% reduction in uses of force after implementation of TASER's AXON flex cameras. In a study by Arizona State University, the Mesa Police Department's use of AXON cameras revealed a 48% reduction in citizen complaints against camera officers for misconduct during the study period, and a 75% decline in use of force complaints.  When complaints were brought to Mesa PD, they were resolved quickly due 
to the accessibility of video evidence., Follow EVIDENCE.com, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

The first order is an upgrade of 2,270 older TASER weapons to the new TASER X26P Smart Weapon together with the TASER Assurance Plan, a program which covers all maintenance and service for these devices over a 5 year period, including a replacement of the device 
with a new TASER Smart Weapon after 5 years.

It is our goal to make these important tools available to every front line officer over the next few years."", ""We are passionate about technology that makes the world a safer place,"" says Rick Smith, Co-Founder and CEO of TASER International.

We believe the LAPD is making an important move toward a world where every officer has the best technology and training to minimize the chances of a deadly encounter."", LAPD was the first major agency to study the impact of TASER devices, when Sergeant Greg Meyer conducted a study comparing injury rates from various force options, which found the TASER had dramatically lower injuries (0%) compared to physical force options (injuries ranged from 45% to 78%). A 2009 study by the Police Executive Research Forum sponsored by the National Institute of Justice found that the use of TASER devices reduced the risk of police officer injuries by 70% and the risk of injury to suspects by 40%. Numerous studies have consistently shown that officers equipped with a TASER device are both safer and less likely to cause injury during response to resistance., The order for 2,270 units was received and shipped in the fourth quarter of 2014.

The order was received in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the cameras are also expected to ship in the same quarter., , In addition to equipping more than 700 Troopers throughout the state with TASER's next-generation body-worn camera devices, the Louisiana State Police purchased a five-year unlimited Evidence.com license with Axon Five image-processing software specifically designed for investigative, forensic and security applications. Each Trooper will also be equipped with a Signal Performance Power Magazine (SPPM), which enables the camera to turn on automatically when an officer's TASER Smart Weapon is armed., To address the unique needs of the statewide agency, the Louisiana State Police has opted to equip each member of its force with two cameras, totaling 1,556 units, thereby effectively doubling the amount of data a Trooper can capture before it becomes necessary to upload video to Evidence.com. At the same time, this decentralization makes the Louisiana State Police an ideal fit for the full Axon network (including Evidence.com and SPPM), as it enables efficient storage, management, and sharing of evidence without requiring centralized servers or filing systems., ""Fully deploying HD body cameras, let alone taking the innovative step of purchasing two per Trooper, is undoubtedly a bold move in the direction of improved accountability and officer protection,"" said TASER CEO and co-founder Rick Smith. ""Combine that with our Axon Signal technology, which virtually ensures that important interactions don't go unrecorded, and you're looking at an agency whose technology can help them get to the truth faster and focus on what matters. We commend them on being one of the first major, statewide agencies to take these steps."", To date, more than 100,000 licenses have been booked on the Axon network worldwide.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR), the global leader in Smart Weapons and digital evidence management solutions for body-worn cameras, today announced it is challenging the validity of Digital Ally patents in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Public documents, including TASER's own presentations from as early as 2009, clearly establish that Digital Ally did not invent ""auto-activation"" camera technology. Under U.S. law, a patent is not valid if it claims technology publicly described by another before the patent's 
filing date. Digital's patents therefore cannot cover TASER's (and others') prior, public innovations in this area., Digital sued TASER earlier this year for alleged infringement of two patents with priority dates in 2013. TASER asserts the complaint is meritless, that its Axon Signal technology does not infringe, and that the asserted patents are invalid. Regarding invalidity, TASER previously filed counterclaims against Digital Ally alleging inequitable conduct in the patent office based on its nondisclosure of highly relevant prior art, including the ICOP 20/20-W system, an in-car video recorder system designed for law enforcement and initiated by a number of automatic triggers including light bar and speed triggers. In addition to its litigation defenses, TASER now affirmatively challenges the validity of Digital's patents directly in the patent office. A petition challenging Digital's second patent in suit will follow in December., ""Normally, we do not comment on ongoing litigation,"" said Doug Klint, TASER's General Counsel. ""However, because Digital Ally has repeatedly and falsely claimed that it invented the technology to wirelessly activate cameras, we felt it appropriate to share our recent filings on this matter to provide our customers and investors with an accurate invention timeline. We believe these public documents clearly demonstrate that Digital Ally did not invent the technology in question, and has attempted improperly to claim the inventions of TASER International and others."", As disclosed in TASER's recent patent office petitions and in litigation discovery, TASER designed and disclosed its own ""TACOM"" (TASER Communications) wireless auto-activation technology at least as early as April 2009, years before Digital's 2013 patent applications. Public proof of TASER's prior design includes at least the following:, , Links to Key Litigation and U.S.P.T.O. Filings, TASER's U.S.P.T.O. petitions and litigation counterclaims listed below may be accessed at www.taser.com/legal. The current petitions address invalidity of Digital's U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292. An additional petition regarding the invalidity of Digital's second patent-in-suit, U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452, will be filed later in December., TASER Social Media Links, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

""In that sense, the last thing we want is for an officer's focus to be drawn away from a critical situation by his or her devices. SPPM's ability to alert Axon cameras of CEW usage will go a long way toward helping users concentrate on what's important. It will be the easiest, most reliable way for officers to tell the full story without ever having to think about anything beyond managing the situation at hand. SPPM joins Axon Signal, which provides similar alerts from actions in a patrol car such as light bar activation, in allowing officers to focus on the environment around them, not their technology."", Details:, , , , TASER Social Media Links, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

We realized strong growth in the period from both our Weapons and Axon businesses, and our Axon bookings remained strong,"" commented Rick Smith, TASER CEO and Founder. ""Customers value the Axon network we have created, which now connects over half of the major cities in the United States, bringing the criminal justice system online with advanced technology and enhanced transparency. We will continue to grow our existing platform offerings while developing complementary capabilities to extend our leadership position with law enforcement around the world."", Third Quarter 2016 Financial Highlights:, Business Highlights:, CFO Transition, TASER also announced today that following a transition period, CFO Dan Behrendt will be leaving the Company to pursue other opportunities. Mr. Behrendt will remain with TASER in his current capacity through the filing of the Company's Form 10-K to help ensure an orderly transition of his responsibilities. The Company has commenced a national search for a new Chief Financial Officer., ""Dan has been an integral part of TASER's success since joining 12 years ago,"" said Mr. Smith.

We've made considerable progress over the last several years, and I'm particularly proud of the finance organization and team we've put in place. After more than a decade with TASER and following an orderly transition period, I'll look forward to pursuing new endeavors."", Quarterly Conference Call:, The Company will host its third quarter 2016 earnings conference call on Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 4:30 p.m. ET. To join the live audio presentation, please dial toll free 877-303-9126, or for international callers, please dial +1-253-237-1156. The passcode is 56350705., The Company has posted supplemental materials including its key operating metrics on its website to provide additional information about our third quarter financial results., The Company plans to update and post its investor relations presentation to http://investor.taser.com within the next two weeks with the third quarter results. Archived presentations from previous quarters can also be found on the website., Statistical Definitions:, Axon cameras and Evidence.com bookings represent a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders placed in the relevant time period. Bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Axon cameras and Evidence.com. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales) placed in the relevant fiscal period, net of cancellations, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Some bookings might be invoiced in subsequent years., Due to municipal government funding rules, certain of the future year amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although TASER has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be completed, if agencies invoke a cancellation clause or do not appropriate funds in future year budgets, revenue associated with these bookings will ultimately not be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR) the global leader in Smart Weapons and digital evidence management solutions with the leading body-worn camera, today announced the addition of Todd Basche as Executive Vice President of Axon Devices. Todd has spent decades developing new products in the technology sector, from his early years innovating hardware solutions for Sun Microsystems to his more recent tenure at Apple, where he was responsible for the creation of iLife (the integrated suite of software including iTunes, iMovie, iDVD and iPhoto). Over the course of his years in the industry, Todd has been a champion of 
creating fantastic user experiences in emerging technologies, working to make cutting edge tools easy-to-use and driving massive user adoption., ""When it comes to breakthrough new product development there are few people who can compete with Todd Basche's decades of experience as a leader in some of the most momentous product ecosystems in the world,"" said TASER CEO and co-founder Rick Smith. ""He has precisely the kind of forward-thinking, user-focused mindset that we value so highly at TASER. I'm exited to see our Axon suite of products becoming even more robust and innovative under his guidance. He is already contributing bold ideas to advance our mission to protect life and protect truth."", ""When I met the team and understood TASER's mission, I knew this was the company for me,"" said Todd Basche. ""I see TASER as a place for me to combine my social consciousness with my high tech skills and have them all come together. It's so amazing to have a job where I can contribute to making communities safer through technology. I am really thrilled to be joining the team."", After beginning his career in the world of enterprise hardware (developing the SPARCstation with Sun Microsystems), Todd quickly branched out, applying his unique set of skills to consumer hardware and software as one of the founders of Visioneer, where his passion for user centric designs led to the creation of a revolutionary personal scanner product that fueled sales and resulted in an IPO in just three years. Later, Todd would create award-winning enterprise software as the general manager of Remedy. While at Apple, he regularly pitched 'new ideas' to Steve Jobs, including the concept for the integrated iLife suite of applications.

customers., ""Our goal for the coming years is to reduce officer paperwork by 80%,"" said TASER CEO and co-founder Rick Smith. ""The best way to accomplish this goal is to focus on improved efficiency in the workflow by gaining intelligent insights into the multimedia stored within an agencies' digital evidence. On-demand transcription helps to make report-writing virtually automatic, while improving the quality of the data stored in Evidence.com. We believe this will empower police officers and prosecutors to work more efficiently and spend more time focusing on what matters,"" concluded Smith., ""SpeakWrite has been providing accurate and secure transcription services for public safety agencies for nearly a decade, and in that time we've developed a keen eye for the unique needs of law enforcement,"" said SpeakWrite CEO and founder Richard Jackson. ""That's why we make our services available 24/7/365, and that's why we're thrilled to partner with TASER, another company with a long track record of meeting officers' needs.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Sept. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon, a business unit of TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR) and the global leader in digital evidence management solutions with the leading body-worn camera, today announced the third annual RISE Award winners in partnership with PoliceOne.com. The RISE Awards seek to honor law enforcement officers and agencies who save lives, find innovative solutions to pressing problems, lead by example and serve their communities with honor. 
The 2016 winners are as follows:, , , , We received more than 200 nominations filled with stories of professionalism and valor for this year's RISE Awards. Each RISE winner receives a $5,000 Axon Technology grant, an all-expenses-paid trip to the 2016 IACP conference in San Diego with VIP access to all TASER events and a one-year subscription to the PoliceOne Academy online training system., ""There's never been a better time to recognize the everyday heroes who rise to the challenge of serving our communities with courage and strength,"" said Rick Smith, co-founder and CEO of TASER. ""We congratulate the winners of this year's RISE Awards and thank all of the nominees for their dedication and commitment to helping build safer communities."", ""At PoliceOne, we're continuously impressed by the examples of valor and exemplary service we see every day from officers across the country,"" said Alex Ford, CEO of PoliceOne. ""We're honored - this year more than ever - to partner with TASER to recognize those who go above and beyond protecting and serving their communities and their fellow officers."", About the Winners, Agency of the Year: Chippewa Falls Police Department (Wisconsin), The Chippewa Falls PD (CFPD) has grown its social media and community policing outreach exponentially, even without a full-time Press Information Officer. Through its Facebook page, CFPD posts safety tips, traffic and weather concerns. Its most popular program, #WANTEDWEDNESDAY, consists of photos and information about persons wanted for local warrants. It boasts about a 90 percent success rate and has even resulted in wanted persons turning themselves in., Social media is also a powerful tool to highlight the good work police officers are doing every day. For Chippewa Falls, broadcasting acts of kindness by their officers serves a dual purpose — it's a way to build trust in the community and boost morale in the department. Read more here., Protect Life: Deputy Karl Griffiths, Sacramento County Sheriff's Department (California), Deputy Karl Griffiths arrived at the scene of an apparent domestic dispute to find his fellow officers outgunned as the suspect was firing rounds from the residence. Griffiths handed off his rifle to the officers taking cover behind their patrol vehicles and ran to help a seriously injured woman, dragging her to safety and calling for assistance. Griffiths stayed with the woman to keep pressure on her neck wound until they reached a hospital. The surgeon later told Griffiths that the woman would have died without his quick response. Read more here., Law Enforcement Leadership: Lt. Anthony Wolfe, Peoria Police Department (Arizona), Lt. Anthony Wolfe manages professional standards and technology for the Peoria Police Department, earning praise for his pragmatic leadership. He champions adoption of useful technology throughout the department and the community, and he has leveraged social media to provide the public with information on warrants, safety programs, drug prevention programs and more., In the past year, Wolfe has implemented several programs for the benefit of Peoria citizens, including a successful bike registration and anti-theft program. That program has expanded into a partnership with the local school district to serialize and register high-dollar school equipment as well., Wolfe also enlisted the help of the community in the fight against crime with the Safe-Cam program, in which citizens and businesses register their security camera locations in a secure database. This allows investigators to quickly identify locations where video footage might exist., These technology efforts were implemented on top of his main professional standards duties overseeing Internal Affairs and Inspections and Audits, where he introduced a leadership training partnership with FBI-LEEDA. Wolfe's dedication to the training and education of his fellow officers helps create a more effective police force and a safer community., Community Impact: Officer Tommy Griffiths Sr., Boston PD (Massachusetts), Officer Tommy Griffiths Sr., Boston Police Department, volunteered more than 500 hours in 2008 to help build a teen center in Franklin Field, one of Boston's toughest housing developments. In 2015, a sewage backup ruined all of the equipment, the computer lab and the furniture, and the center was shut down. Griffiths, a former chief of construction for the city, once again stepped in to champion the project, organizing an army of volunteers to renovate and restore the center - despite having no funding whatsoever - and the center reopened on July 15. Read more here., Follow the TASER and Axon brand here:, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

The decision follows a 12-month trial period during which West Midlands Police performed trials with two body camera solutions, ultimately choosing the Axon solution for its seamless integrations and ability to securely manage and share 
digital evidence from capture to courtroom. This order was received and shipped in the second quarter of 2016., In addition to deploying Axon Body 2 cameras and Evidence.com, officers will also be using Axon Capture and Axon View mobile applications. From capturing audio evidence to live streaming video in the field, these mobile apps helped solidify the Axon solution as the best fit within the framework of WMP2020, West Midlands Police's five year transformation program., ""For us Evidence.com is cost effective, flexible, secure and we can easily share with third parties like the courts, CPS, defenses and others,"" said Chief Superintendent Chris Todd from West Midlands Police.""In addition to providing us a central repository for securely managing our digital evidence, the Axon solution also provides an opportunity for us to present better evidence in the courtroom."", ""In just the last 6 months, several of the largest forces in the UK, the Met, GMP and West Midlands, have made long term investments in body-worn video and associated Digital Evidence Management solutions,"" said Matt Spencer, Managing Director of Axon Public Safety UK. ""Forces are now recognising that it's not just about the body-worn video camera. They understand that it's about the different ways in which you capture digital evidence and then how you manage, retrieve, securely store and share that data. It's about the end to end workflow of that evidence so it can be used to protect the truth and protect victims of crime. Hyper-cloud technologies like Evidence.com are driving how we use digital 
evidence in order to achieve these positive outcomes for forces. The cloud is the key enabler and today we are only seeing a fraction of what is going to be possible in the next 3-5 years."", About Axon & Evidence.com Platform:, Thousands of law enforcement agencies to date are now utilizing the Axon platform, allowing them to seamlessly integrate software and hardware to enable powerful capabilities.

Archived presentations from previous quarters may also be found on the website., Statistical Definitions:, Non-GAAP Measures:, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we are presenting the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow.

the future year amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses.  Although TASER has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and

The TASER Pulse can be seen at the SHOT Show new product display on January 19-22 on Level 3, located outside of the Press Room and Member's Lounge at 
booth N708 in the Sands Convention Center, Las Vegas, NV., ""The TASER Pulse conducted electrical weapon is the first of its kind: a discreet carry, sub-compact self-defense weapon and our first updated consumer model since 2007,"" said TASER International CEO and founder Rick Smith. ""I founded TASER International in 1993 to create safer personal protection technology - and the TASER Pulse continues in that tradition. While we've sold more than 250,000 TASER devices to civilians, our primary focus has been on improving public safety through law enforcement. The debut of the TASER Pulse is a recommitment to our company's core mission to protect life and to help citizens who want to safely protect their families. This high-tech, easy-to-use weapon is built for concealed carry but packs the same 
knock-down punch that has become the standard for law enforcement around the world. We encourage all Americans to have a safety plan and the TASER Pulse should be part of that discussion,"" concluded Smith., The TASER Pulse is the first device to incorporate our state-of-the-art technology into a sub-compact form factor. The TASER Pulse was designed with our customers in mind who wanted a small weapon with the most effective stopping power available. Many of the discreet carry improvements include: shaved safeties, sloped 'iron sights,' targeting laser and high visibility flashlight tucked into an intuitive sub-compact design., ""We removed many of the industrial features required for law enforcement use such as data logs, pulse logging and charge metering, live displays and the TASER CAM interface, while using our patented Shaped Pulse (TM) electrical waveform to create the smallest, easily concealable form factor at an affordable price point,"" said Mike Gish, Vice President of TASER Weapon Strategy. ""Despite an introductory price as low as $399, we haven't sacrificed the effective knock-down power,"" concluded Gish., ""This is a tremendous redesign for TASER's civilian line of products and truly propels them to the top of the self-defense market. Because of our confidence in their new team and brand, we've chosen to represent them as they make a renewed push into the retail market with this fresh product line,"" said Wade Lynton, Sr., Vice President of Sales and Marketing for The Evans Group. ""We feel the dramatic improvements provide civilians a safe and responsible means to protect themselves and their loved ones in dangerous situations where a firearm might not be advisable,"" concluded Lynton., The TASER Pulse package includes the TASER Pulse, two disposable TASER cartridges, a soft carry protective cover, a battery pack, and a conductive practice target. It is scheduled to begin shipping in the first quarter of 2016., Features of the TASER Pulse:, Measuring only 5 ¼-inches long, 4 ½-inches tall, and 1 1/8-inches wide, the TASER Pulse was designed from the ground up as a discreet carry device., TASER ""Safe Escape"" Product Replacement Program, TASER Pulse website: http://buy.taser.com/products/taser-pulse, TASER Pulse images:  https://brandfolder.com/taser?q=section%3A%22Consumer%22, Follow the TASER Self-Defense brand here:, About TASER International, Inc., TASER makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Jan. 19, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International (NASDAQ: TASR), which makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies, typically does not comment on pending litigation, but the Company felt compelled to respond to what is, in our opinion, a frivolous and egregious lawsuit filed by Digital Ally against TASER for patent infringement. This lawsuit asserts infringement of Digital Ally's U.S. Patent No. 8,781,292 (""the '292 patent""). The patent claims, as originally issued in the '292 patent, underwent reexamination by the U.S. Patent 
Office because there was a ""substantial"" question of patentability of all patent claims in the '292 patent. These claims were subsequently rejected in view of prior art. To overcome rejections issued by the U.S. Patent Office, Digital Ally had to amend the rejected claims with significant limitations—limitations that, in our opinion, significantly narrowed the patent claims and further strengthen our position that TASER did not and does not infringe any claim of the '292 patent., ""TASER values patent rights, including those of our competitors, and as such, we use a best practice intellectual property (IP) clearance process before starting any technology project,"" stated Doug Klint, TASER's General Counsel. ""We conduct extensive prior art and patent searches and develop a patent landscape analysis using outside patent counsel experts to guide us as we develop our products. Our IP counsel meets with our engineering team to ensure an appropriate design to circumvent even remote third party patent claims. In addition, we obtain opinions regarding the risk of infringement from outside IP counsel for all of our technology projects. In the case of our Signal technology, the Seattle IP law firm of Christensen O'Connor Johnson Kindness PLLC will be representing us in the Digital Ally litigation together with in-house counsel. TASER has been 
very successful in defending litigation and we have prevailed in all previous patent lawsuits with competitors. We believe we will prevail in this litigation as well,"" concluded Klint., Follow the TASER and Axon brand here:, About TASER International, Inc., TASER International makes communities safer with innovative public safety technologies.

/*--><!]]>*/, LAS VEGAS, and SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Use-of-force complaints fell dramatically at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) after the agency deployed Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN) body-worn cameras, a recent independent study revealed. The study, conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), and CNA, a non-profit research and analysis organization, also found that the implementation of body cameras resulted in a decrease in police misconduct. The full study can be found here: 
https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/IRM-2017-U-016112-Final.pdf., , The year-long study, funded by the U.S. Department of Justice, began in 2014 and concluded in 2015. The study evaluated 416 officers, 218 of whom donned Axon body cameras. Researchers unveiled the following significant findings:, Researchers also performed a cost-benefit analysis and found that body-worn cameras could ultimately save LVMPD up to $4 million per year in legal fees., ""The results of this study by UNLV validate what we have been seeing all along - the body-worn camera has taken an out-of-focus picture and made it clear,"" says Clark County, Nevada Sheriff Joseph Lombardo. ""While some officers initially feared the devices would be intrusive, many now embrace the technology because video can prove or disprove accounts by arrestees and witnesses."", ""We're thrilled that body cameras continue to be studied and that researchers are discovering positive effects for both the public and police officers,"" says Axon CEO and founder Rick Smith. ""The cost benefits brought to light in this study have a tremendous impact on agencies and the communities they serve. Saving money on legal fees ultimately leads to more officers being on the street. Benefits like these are exactly why we are working so hard to develop the next generation of police technology."", To date, LVMPD has purchased about 2,000 Axon body-worn cameras, which upload video to Axon's cloud-based digital evidence management solution, Evidence.com.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, today announced a groundbreaking case study demonstrating the effects of body-worn cameras on domestic and family violence (DFV) cases. The case study was conducted in conjunction with the Queensland Police Service (QPS) in Australia. It showed an increase in charges filed, arrests and convictions for DFV cases following a deployment of 5,100 Axon body-worn cameras by the agency. A video highlighting the results of the study can be viewed here: https://vimeo.com/239673451, , In light of the more than 5,000 responses to DFV cases each week by Australian law enforcement, QPS mandated that all officers document DFV situations with their body-worn cameras. The presence of body-worn cameras at the scene of the incident has proven to cause abusers to admit guilt and avoid a trial, saving time and money for police agencies. In cases that have gone to trial, the presence of video has led to an increase in conviction rates. Subsequently, more victims have been encouraged to come forward and report on incidents of not only domestic violence, but assaults and life-endangering acts., Since the QPS implemented their new policy on documenting all DFV situations with their Axon body cameras in 2015, more than 50,000 videos pertaining to DFV cases have been uploaded. The case study, conducted between July 2016 and September 1, 2017, revealed the following results:, ""The after-image of a domestic violence incident tends to be messy and chaotic - from even one frame it's obvious that things are not normal,"" says Detective Inspector Marc Hogan of the Queensland Police Service. ""Capturing that chaos on paper used to be virtually impossible, but Axon has enabled us to preserve these tragic scenes. Domestic and family violence continues to be an issue across Australia, but thanks to this technology we are making real strides - both toward increasing visibility and bringing a greater number of prosecutions."", ""Seeing the Queensland Police Service success in this area has been truly inspiring,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""Not only has the body-worn camera initiative enabled law enforcement to more effectively prosecute these cases, but it has given citizens the confidence and courage to increasingly come forward with their own stories. Seeing QPS's success only reinforces our vision of a future defined by more efficient policing, increased time in the field for officers, and a strengthened bond of trust between agencies and the citizens they protect."", About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer.

(Nasdaq: AAXN), today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017., , In Q3, we delivered solid growth against our long-term plan of delivering our end-to-end technology platform for public safety. We demonstrated leadership across product categories, furthering our dominance in TASER weapons and strengthening our position in body-worn cameras. Since our last update, we also made strides with our new in-car Axon Fleet offering, completed beta testing on Signal Sidearm, and rolled out new software updates and an entirely new software capability, Axon Citizen., At the same time, we also made necessary investments to strengthen our finance and information technology functions to better position our company for long-term sustainable growth and profitability. While we continue to expand our addressable market with leading technology solutions and scale our organization accordingly, we are transitioning our body camera business to focus on improved operating leverage in 2018., The body camera business is evolving from the early market formation and growth phase towards the profitability phase. As the body camera business enters the next phase, we are accelerating innovation. We have several major new growth initiatives, including the Axon Fleet in-car video system, International Markets, and Records Management System (""RMS"") where we are expanding our market-leading software and sensors platform with significant new revenue opportunities. We intend to provide more information on the profitability of our maturing business lines and significant new market opportunities at our upcoming Investor & Analyst Day on November 16 in New York., We look forward to discussing our Q3 results on our conference call at 5 p.m. ET., Summary of Q3 2017 Results:, Net sales increased 26% to $90.3 million in Q3 2017 compared to $71.9 million in Q3 2016. International sales were $17.1 million in the current quarter, up from $13.4 million in Q2 2017 and $11.3 million in Q3 2016., Consolidated gross margin was 55% in Q3 2017 compared to 65% in Q3 2016. We discuss gross margin by segment in the sections below., Gross profit of $49.8 million was impacted by the following factors:, Total operating expenses in Q3 2017 were $50.6 million compared to $35.5 million in Q3 2016., Operating expenses were $3.1 million above guidance largely based on the following factors:, Selling, general and administrative expenses were $36.4 million. SG&A also reflected new recurring amortization expense related to the acquisition of our Australian distributor, which was not in our original forecast. This acquisition sets the foundation for us to drive greater sales at higher net margins via direct customer relationships going forward., Research and development expenses were $14.2 million in the quarter, which reflects our investment in new product offerings, including Axon Fleet, RMS, and another significant program that we expect to announce and ship in 2018., Loss from operations was $0.8 million in Q3 2017 compared to income of $11.1 million in Q3 2016. The decrease in operating income was tied to gross margin compression as well as an increase in total operating expenses in the quarter., Net income for Q3 2017 was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to $3.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in Q3 2016., Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 2017 was $7.0 million compared to $13.8 million in Q3 2016. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by adding back $4.0 million in stock-based compensation expense to EBITDA., In Q3 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $6.6 million. Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $61.8 million at September 30, 2017, or flat sequentially, even after funding the $4.2 million purchase price of Breon Enterprises, our Australian distributor., We are executing on our stated objective of managing down inventory. Total inventory in the quarter decreased to $52.7 million, from $60.7 million at the end of Q2 2017. We remain on track to be below $50 million of inventory by year end., TASER Weapons:, TASER Weapons segment revenue increased 12% to $59.4 million in Q3 2017 compared to $52.9 million in Q3 2016 as we executed against our mission of making a TASER conducted electric weapon (""CEW"") available to every officer., TASER Weapons segment gross margin was 68% in Q3 2017 compared to 72% in Q3 2016. The weapons margin performance in Q3 reflects a greater mix of X2 weapons and the pricing impact of bundling with initial Axon Fleet orders. Our entry into the Axon Fleet market is showing signs of early success, but with new product launches into new markets, our ramp carries increased costs of deployment as well as customer accommodations and discounts. Under generally accepted accounting principles, a discount on one element of a multi-element deal must be applied proportionally across the elements, regardless of the appearance on the customer invoice statement., Three large domestic weapons orders benefited the quarter including a large state's department of public safety, a metropolitan police department, and a US federal agency. Internationally, we are demonstrating traction on our improved go-to-market strategy in which we are investing in direct sales teams rather than relying on third-party distributors. For the first time, this quarter we offered our TASER 60 plan in the UK and received an order for 2,700 X2 weapons via the TASER 60 Premium subscription plan. We also received another international order for more than 1,000 X26P weapons. Both orders resulted from our improved international sales strategy., The TASER 60 payment plan, which we introduced in Q2 2016, continues to be well-received. In Q3, approximately 43% of units ordered, including from international customers, were on the TASER 60, Officer Safety Plan, or TASER Assurance Plan payment options. The TASER 60 is a five-year annual payment plan that allows agencies to reliably budget for the TASER CEW in their operating budget, which is simpler for many customers than procuring and maintaining the CEW via their capital budgets. The payment plan is also a key step in our long-term strategy of shortening upgrade cycles, increasing the ratio of TASER CEWs to patrol officers, and setting the stage to launch additional software and service plans in 2018., Software & Sensors:, Software and Sensors segment revenue grew 63% year over year to $30.8 million in Q3 2017 compared to $18.9 million in Q3 2016., Annual recurring service revenue doubled year over year to $63.7 million in Q3 2017 compared to $32.0 million in Q3 2016., Both product and service revenue broke records in Q3 2017. Software and Sensors product revenue was $14.6 million in Q3 2017 compared to $10.3 million in Q3 2016. Software and Sensors service revenue was $16.3 million in Q3 2017 compared to $8.7 million in Q3 2016., Software and Sensors segment gross margin was 31% in Q3 2017 compared to 45% in Q3 2016., Service gross margin was 64% in Q3 2017, compared to 81% in Q3 2016. Cost of services delivered was $5.9 million in the third quarter. The data migration from AWS to Microsoft Azure's government cloud negatively affected Software and Sensors service gross margin. We incurred a total of $1.4 million of migration and duplicate storage cost in Q3 compared with our previous forecast of $0.8 million. Additionally, cost of services included $0.5 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to the Misfit acquisition, which was put into service in 2017 after previously having been classified as research and development expense. Net of the duplicate storage and migration costs and the amortization reclassification, cost of services delivered would have been $4.0 million, and service margin would have been 
75%., While the migration of existing data was completed, we expect to incur another $1.0 million in expense to fully compete the transition to Microsoft Azure., Hardware product margin (excluding services) was negative 5% in Q3 2017 compared to positive 15% in Q3 2016. Gross margin was largely affected by three factors: the large hardware shipments at low pricing into international beachhead markets, greater discounts and costs during the Axon Fleet launch, and costs and discounts associated with discounts on up-front hardware on multi-year contracts., Hardware gross margin for the segment in the quarter reflects pricing on certain large international beachhead accounts at levels that we do not expect going forward., Our early Axon Fleet deals, some of which were booked in 2015 and early 2016, included discounted pricing and strategic concessions on accessories such as routers needed for data flows. We started to meaningfully scale Axon Fleet with approximately 1,600 units shipped in Q3 2017. Newer Axon Fleet deals do not have the same level of discounting as earlier contracts., Further, we did not receive the full benefit we expected from standardizing the terms and conditions across our contracts as it relates to cancellation provisions. These provisions will allow us to recognize the revenue allocated to the hardware at the time of shipment. We expect to see some uplift in margins in Q4 2017 to the extent we ship a larger percentage of contracts with the modified contract terms., We expect significant improvements in hardware margins in our body camera segment over the next several quarters, and expect margins to exceed 25% in Q1 2018, excluding Axon Fleet pass-through hardware., While the segment's margin performance in the period obscures the long-term margin strength in our business model, our positioning has never been stronger in the market. Customer demand remains very high as highlighted by our $78.0 million in bookings in the period. Recent investments in new product functionality and better performance are driving larger contracts upfront and early contract renewals with higher annual contract values. Our customers see and appreciate the value in our end-to-end solution. This total solution improves the workflow of everyone in the network, including officers, prosecutors and defenders., For example, one of our earliest metropolitan area body-worn camera customers recently chose to upgrade its camera contract before it came up for renewal. The department signed onto our Officer Safety Plan, which bundles one TASER smart weapon, two body-worn camera upgrades, unlimited Evidence.com storage, and full warranty, repair and replacement coverage over a five-year contract, and carries an MSRP of $99 per month per officer., As of the end of the third quarter of 2017, 38 of the 68 U.S. major city law enforcement agencies have purchased Axon body-worn cameras and/or its digital evidence management solution: Albuquerque, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Baltimore County, Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Fort Worth, Fresno, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Louisville, Memphis, Mesa, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Montgomery County, New Orleans, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Tampa, 
Toronto, Tucson, Washington DC, and Wichita., Axon's Evidence.com platform user count continued to grow, extending our market leadership. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we booked approximately 18,400 seats on our digital evidence management platform, Evidence.com, net of renewals. Since inception, we have booked cumulative Evidence.com licenses of approximately 187,400., We also recorded 12 competitor conversion wins in Q3 2017 where our body-worn camera or Axon Fleet offering displaced a competitor, and we recorded four expansions where a state or major city police agency chose to upsize their contracts and expand their reliance upon the Axon network., Product Pipeline:, We are pleased with the pace of our software product development as we study our customers' market needs and respond with technology solutions. Since our last quarterly update in August, we released Axon Citizen, a public safety portal that allows community members to submit evidence directly to law enforcement agencies for crimes under investigation. The two components to Axon Citizen are a tool that allows one-on-one communication between an officer and the citizen and a capability that allows a community-wide broadcast requesting information on a specific crime. The one-on-one tool is available now for Axon customers signed up for early access and will be available to U.S. customers on the Evidence.com Pro, Ultimate, or Unlimited licensing tiers at no incremental cost later this year. The 
large-event community broadcast Citizen tool will be priced later this year as an Enterprise add-on., Evidence.com is continuously improving as we roll out monthly updates to agency customers. In Q3 2017, we released enhancements to our search, access control, and reporting functionalities. These updates were driven by customer feedback and collaboration with our sales, customer support, and product management teams. Positive customer feedback validates our cloud-based digital evidence management approach., We are seeing strong customer interest in Signal Sidearm, which we announced in Q1 2017. We finished beta testing in October and it is available to ship for all Axon customers in Q4 2017. Signal Sidearm is a smart sensor that attaches to most firearm holsters currently used by law enforcement. When a firearm is removed from its holster, a wireless alert is sent to all Axon cameras within range to begin recording and capture buffered video from a set number of seconds before the incident., As we have said before, we are investing in artificial intelligence (""AI"") and machine learning. While our AI Research investments are pre-revenue, we received a major validation of our growing capability in the quarter. The Los Angeles Police Department chose Axon over several competitors to be its AI technology supplier for a special video analytics project. A panel of reviewers evaluated each competitor's work and Axon's solution resulted in the most accurate results with the greatest potential to assist the department directly. LAPD received a federal grant to pay for the project, and though it is not material to results, we believe the win points to our strategic advantage of having an industry leading team specifically focusing on AI solutions for law enforcement., Our Records Management System (""RMS"") remains on track to ship in 2018 to select agencies in our early access program. In Q3 2017, we signed one major agency and a number of smaller agencies as early access RMS partners. Customers tell us that our RMS offering cannot come soon enough — today's police officers can spend up to two-thirds of a given shift performing administrative tasks. Outdated software prevents front-line officers from maximizing their time spent in their communities. In 2016, we announced our plans to reduce police paperwork by 80% within the next ten years through an RMS solution that seamlessly integrates with an agency's computer-aided dispatch system (CAD). Axon's cloud-based digital evidence management solution, Evidence.com and our wide array of audio video sensors using new AI processing capabilities will automate the 
capture and processing of information. We are executing against that goal., Outlook:, We expect full year revenue growth to exceed 25%, well above our original expectation of 15% to 20% growth in 2017., We expect Q4 2017 gross margin to show slight improvement, benefiting from lower data migration expenses and higher pricing on upfront hardware on multi-year deals, but offset by our aggressive move into the in-car video market., We expect a sequential increase in operating expenses of 5% to 8% in Q4 2017, driven by R&D investments and seasonal sales and marketing activities. We are actively working to adjust the trajectory of our operating expense growth rate to drive leverage., We remain excited about the strength of our team and our product offering and look forward to providing an overview of our long-term vision at our Investor & Analyst Day in New York on November 16, which will be Webcast at http://investor.axon.com/., Signed,, Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST:, The Company will host its Q3 2017 earnings conference call on Tuesday, November 7, 2017 at 5 p.m. ET. To join the live audio presentation, please dial toll free 877-303-9126, or for international callers, please dial +1-253-237-1156., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at http://investor.axon.com/., The Company has posted supplemental materials including its key operating metrics on its website to provide additional information about our third quarter financial results., Statistical Definitions:, Bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Axon hardware and Evidence.com. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales contract value (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent years., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future year amounts included in bookings are subject contractual options being exercised and to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be completed, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings will not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings. In the third quarter of 2017, the Company did not record any reversals related to prior period bookings due to non-appropriation or other cancellation reasons., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures:, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented at the end of the release., EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is defined as EBITDA before certain other items, including: stock-based compensation; net gain/loss on write-down/disposal of property, equipment and intangible assets; and loss on impairment., Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, these non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's GAAP financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the Company's GAAP financial measures; and these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with GAAP and investors should not assume that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principles. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not 
enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer.

/*--><!]]>*/, Trials of Axon Citizen now underway at a number of Canadian police agencies, ABBOTSFORD, British Columbia and SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 6, 2017 /CNW/ -- Axon Public Safety Canada Inc., a subsidiary of Axon Enterprise, Inc. (NASDAQ: AAXN), today announced that Axon Citizen is now available to police agencies in Canada. A number of Canadian agencies, including Abbotsford Police Department, BC, are conducting trials of Axon Citizen, which allows community members to submit evidence directly to police services, from their mobile devices, for specific crimes under investigation. Learn more by visiting https://ca.axon.com/citizen., , There are two ways in which officers can solicit help from the community: one-on-one between an officer and the citizen, or with a community-wide broadcast requesting information on a specific crime. The one-on-one tool, is available now for Axon customers signed up for early access. It is available to all customers on the Evidence.com Pro, Ultimate, or Unlimited licensing tiers at no incremental cost, with no additional storage fees, next month. The large-event community broadcast Citizen tool will include additional software capabilities to help triage the massive amounts of data that may be submitted and will be available for an additional enterprise license based on the size of the agency., The citizen receives a URL via text message that they can click to upload their photos or video footage. The evidence goes straight into Evidence.com so community members do not need to hand their phones over to police. The direct upload to Evidence.com eliminates any need for officers to download, print and transfer data to a USB drive and physically place it inside an evidence locker at the agency., ""We received numerous requests from police services in Canada to help streamline the process of evidence collection from the public and local businesses,"" says Vishal Dhir, Axon's Managing Director, Canada and Latin America. ""Axon Citizen offers a solution to this problem by allowing videos and photos to go straight from the community into the police department's Evidence.com account. I'm excited about this tool as it does exactly that — it maximizes officer efficiency, while giving the public an easy way to share information with their local police service."", Additional features and benefits of Axon Citizen include:, Axon is showcasing Axon Citizen today through November 9 at the APCO Canada 2017 Conference & Tradeshow in Windsor, ON at booth number 301. The Axon team will also be speaking at the APCO session, ""Next Generation 9-1-1 and Public Evidence Submissions of Digital Evidence: The Future is Now,"" on November 8 at 2:15 p.m. ET., *Axon Citizen will do everything possible to not capture obvious attribution data without tampering with the evidence submission, or destroying the usefulness of the submitted evidence. To be clear, while Evidence.com is not capturing any personal contact information, there is still metadata embedded in the image being submitted, and the inherent contextual information in the image/video/audio itself that could be used through investigative efforts by law enforcement to identify the submitter., About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps, and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer. Our mission is to protect life. Our technologies give law enforcement the confidence, focus, and time they need to keep their communities safe. Our products impact every aspect of an officer's day-to-day experience:, We work hard for those who put themselves in harm's way for all of us. To date, there are more than 169,000 licensed users from around the world and more than 191,000 lives and countless dollars have been saved with the Axon network of devices, apps and people.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. and SEATTLE, Oct. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, today announced Axon Citizen, a public safety portal that allows community members to submit evidence directly to law enforcement agencies only for crimes under investigation. There are two ways in which officers can solicit help from the community: one-on-one between an officer and the citizen, or with a community-wide broadcast requesting information on a specific crime. The one-on-one tool is available now for Axon customers signed up for early access. It will be 
available to all U.S. customers on the Evidence.com Pro, Ultimate, or Unlimited licensing tiers at no incremental cost, with no additional storage fees, later this year. The large-event community broadcast Citizen tool will include additional software capabilities to help triage the massive amounts of data that may be submitted and will be available for an additional enterprise license based on the size of the agency. Learn more by visiting www.axon.com/citizen., , ""Axon Citizen is a great example of the power of our cloud based technology model,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""Our customers will receive the breakthrough ability to collect one-on-one information from members of the community via a seamless software update. Similar to when we launched multi-cam sync a few months ago, we endeavor to delight our customers with unexpected new features that extend the capability of their Axon experience."", With the increasing prevalence of photos and video recordings being captured on mobile devices, Axon Citizen enables law enforcement agencies to securely receive and manage community submissions relating to a specific crime. The citizen receives a URL via text message that they can click to upload their photos or video footage. The evidence goes straight into Evidence.com so community members do not need to hand their phones over to police. The direct upload to Evidence.com eliminates any need for officers to download, print and transfer data to a USB drive and physically place it inside an evidence locker at the agency., Axon Citizen will include the following features and benefits:, Axon's Evidence.com solution is a trusted and proven cloud service that provides law enforcement secure workflows and sharing capabilities to aid in the management of digital evidence. We are committed to the ongoing security, privacy and compliance of the Evidence.com service and data stored within. Evidence.com maintains ISO 27001 and ISO 27018 certifications, has been awarded the Cloud Security Alliance's STAR Level 2 attestation, and has contractually committed to the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy within all states., In addition to working with public safety agencies, Axon surveyed a sampling of more than 1,500 community members nationwide to develop a system that would suit their needs. The survey found that more than one-fifth (21%) of respondents had captured digital evidence pertinent to a police investigation, but fewer than half (45%) had submitted that evidence to the police. More than half of respondents (65%) were extremely likely or somewhat likely to proceed with sharing evidence if only a text message was involved. With this valuable community input, we were able to create a product that meets the needs of both law enforcement officers and citizens., We will be showcasing Axon Citizen along with other products at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Philadelphia on October 22-23, at Booth Number 2825., *Axon Citizen will do everything possible to not capture obvious attribution data without tampering with the evidence submission, or destroying the usefulness of the submitted evidence. To be clear, while Evidence.com is not capturing any personal contact information, there is still metadata embedded in the image being submitted, and the inherent contextual information in the image/video/audio itself that could be used through investigative efforts by law enforcement to identify the submitter., About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer. Our mission is to protect life. Our technologies give law enforcement the confidence, focus and time they need to keep their communities safe. Our products impact every aspect of an officer's day-to-day experience:, We work hard for those who put themselves in harm's way for all of us.

However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), formerly TASER International, the global leader in less lethal conducted electrical weapon (CEW) technologies, today announced the entry of a broad permanent injunction against Florida-based Phazzer Electronics, Inc. banning sales of the infringing Phazzer Enforcer CEWs and dart cartridges. The injunction entered Friday by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida prohibits Phazzer and its officers, agents, employees, and anyone else acting in concert with them, from making, using, offering for sale, selling, distributing, importing or exporting Phazzer CEWs and associated 
cartridges. Phazzer is further enjoined from dumping its infringing inventory by ""donating"" CEWs to law enforcement, and from false advertising and comparison to TASER® brand products., , The Court's Order has clear international consequences since both Phazzer and its U.S. distributors are barred from exporting CEWs or cartridges to fill foreign orders. The injunction also makes clear that nonparties who assist Phazzer in violating the injunction, including specifically Taiwanese CEW manufacturer Sang Min International and Double Dragon Development and Trading Corporation, may be held in contempt of court., ""This is a huge win for us,"" said Doug Klint, Axon General Counsel. ""We aggressively defend our intellectual property rights and have a proven track record of success in litigating these cases. We successfully prosecuted infringement cases with Stinger Systems and Karbon Arms before Phazzer. Willful infringement of our weapons technology will never be tolerated, and we will not allow competitors to trade on TASER's goodwill and reputation for quality,"" Klint said., TASER obtained a judgment and permanent injunction against Stinger Systems' infringing S-200 CEW in 2010, and against Karbon Arms' infringing MPID CEW in 2014, putting both companies out of business. Phazzer is now also apparently ""insolvent,"" according to documents publicly filed by its counsel., In imposing severe sanctions against Phazzer, including an award of Axon's attorneys' fees and costs, the Court found that Phazzer ""engaged in a pattern of bad faith conduct designed and intended to delay, stall, and increase the cost of this litigation,"" and that Phazzer repeatedly disregarded Court Orders thereby exhibiting ""contemptuous"", ""egregious"", ""flagrant"" and ""intentional obstructionist behavior"" resulting in willful ""abuse [of] the judicial process."" ""It is truly stunning,"" Klint said, ""that a company which seeks to do business with law enforcement would show such distain to the Court and our system of justice."", Axon's patent (U.S. No. 7,234,262) at issue in the litigation (Case No. 6:16-cv-00366-PGB-KRS) relates to the CEW's data recording of date and time of each trigger operation and duration of the stimulus. The Court found that patent was ""valid, enforceable, and infringed by Phazzer."" The injunction will remain in effect until the patent expires, and includes any CEW or device not colorably different from the Phazzer Enforcer CEW., The Axon trademark that is the subject of the injunction is Federal Registration No. 4,423,789, relating to the non-functional shape of TASER CEW cartridges used to launch the darts. The Court found the trademark ""valid and enforceable, not generic, functional, or merely descriptive, and infringed by Phazzer."" The permanent injunction covers all Phazzer CEW dart cartridges that are confusingly similar to, or not more than a colorable imitation of, TASER CEW cartridges, and expressly includes Phazzer product numbers 1-DC15, 1-DC21, 1-DC25, 1-DC21-SIDT, 1-PB30, 1-PB8F, 1-PB15943, 1-RB30, 1-PA30, and 1-LOWIMPT2015., The Court expressly found that Phazzer cartridges currently marketed and sold as compatible with TASER brand CEWs embody the protected appearance and constitute infringing products enjoined under its Order. Phazzer was also ordered by the Court ""not [to] challenge or continue to challenge the validity or enforceability of the '789 Registration in any manner in any forum, including the USTPO."" Accordingly, Phazzer's pending USPTO cancellation action, which was stayed while the litigation ran its course, will be dismissed., About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer.

The pilot is designed to provide value to the Durham Region Police Members and the community with respect to improving the quality of evidence collected, enhancing public trust and ultimately service effectiveness., ""Axon has a secure, easy-to-use solution that helps reduce manual tasks, prevent data silos, and promote efficiency,"" said Axon CEO and co-founder Rick Smith. ""When we say 'get to the truth faster,' this is exactly what we mean — that, given the chance to utilize this platform, agencies will see an immediate transformation in the way they manage digital evidence. It's time to make sure that everyone has that chance."", By streamlining virtually all aspects of the criminal justice process, from evidence capture to sharing with Crown prosecutors for trial, Axon's solution helps increase convictions while decreasing time to trial, thereby saving agencies money and time. For that reason, the company is determined to ensure that all agencies across Canada are given the opportunity to field trial the Axon platform., ""We see this as a great opportunity for Services to gather more data on the effectiveness of these tools in the context of Canadian policing,"" said Vishal Dhir, Axon's Managing Director for Canada and Latin America. ""Axon is seeing great results after body-worn camera deployments in the US, UK, Australia, and now across Canada. We're seeing targeted programs having positive impacts on addressing Domestic Partner Violence and streamlining sharing with Crown, which leads to faster prosecutions and greater efficiency for all involved."", In order to meet these challenges that face modern Canadian police agencies, Axon will ensure that all departments across Canada have access to this technology. The offer includes:, For additional information on how to sign up for the offer please visit: www.ca.axon.com/trial.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. and PULLMAN, Wash., June 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- At the annual Axon Accelerate User Conference, Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, and Washington State University (WSU) announced their intent to form a strategic partnership for further research that may improve law enforcement training and police-community relations. In a set of landmark studies published in 2017, researchers at WSU's new Complex Social Interaction (CSI) laboratory have analyzed body-worn camera footage to gain a more thorough and complete understanding of police use of force and 
police-community interaction. To aid the CSI team in their ongoing research, Axon will provide the researchers with body-worn cameras and access to its digital evidence management solution, Evidence.com, free of charge. The donated technology will allow researchers to generate their own research footage via cadets enrolled in WSU's Police Corps program and analyze it along with other data that local agencies choose to share with them. This partnership will provide them with the necessary tools and information for WSU to develop new algorithms for understanding use of force videos., , While statistics relating to police use of force have long been collected and made available to the public, the information provided by those statistics has been limited, indicating only whether use of force occurred and the type of force used. Led by Dr. David Makin, assistant professor of Criminal Justice and Criminology at WSU, the CSI lab uses advanced scientific tools and techniques such as data analytics, biometrics and machine learning to examine the complex factors that shape interactions between police and community members. By examining data from body-worn cameras, the team can contextualize use of force, such as how quickly it occurs, the severity and duration., By working with local law enforcement agencies, CSI researchers have demonstrated the type of insights that can be derived when body-worn camera footage is sequenced and subjected to these analyses. This represents a promising first step toward fully leveraging body-worn camera (BWC) technology, not only for improved safety and accountability, but also for actionable insights about the nature of police work. Thanks to its partnership with Axon, the CSI lab will undertake a range of experiments that explore the situational and dynamic factors associated with police decision-making and the efficacy of police training. In the future, this research may help public safety agencies identify areas for improvement in their training, policies and protocols and ultimately improve police-community relations., ""The research that David Makin and his team are doing at WSU is groundbreaking,"" said Axon CEO and founder Rick Smith. ""We believe that it represents another exciting avenue for body-worn camera usage, potentially leading to the development of tools that will make BWC footage more useful for training and for understanding patterns of behavior. Our core mission is to protect life, which means protecting officers and citizens alike, so we're thrilled to support researchers like those at CSI who obviously share that mission,"" Smith said., ""This cutting-edge research and technology will have real-world applications for improving organizations and decision-making at the individual level,"" Makin said. ""Our goal is to help public safety agencies improve police-community relations, reduce conflict, cost and liability, and enhance the health and well-being of law officers and their communities."", ""This is an excellent example of a win-win public-private partnership with the potential to generate cost savings for police departments and bring new products to the market,"" added Brian Kraft, director of Business Development for WSU's College of Arts and Sciences and director of Innovation and Industrial Research Engagement for the Office of Research., Bryce J. Dietrich, assistant professor of Social Science Informatics at the University of Iowa, commented further on the partnership saying, ""As one of the most recent hires of the Iowa Informatics Initiative, I am excited to work with Axon and the rest of the CSI team at Washington State University to help better understand how data from body-worn cameras can be used to improve officer and public safety."", About the CSI lab at WSU, Led by Dr. David Makin, an expert in police technology and training, the interdisciplinary, intercollegiate CSI research team is the first to explore police officer decision-making and interpersonal interaction by examining data from body-worn cameras. The lab has already analyzed more than 2,000 police-community interactions and numerous other records from actual policing incidents to identify, code and catalog key variables associated with a range of outcomes. Location, lighting, time of day, number of people present, gender, race, verbal and physical stress, and intensity of the interaction are among the myriad of contextual factors researchers have been able to assess. This ground-breaking approach combines automated and manual coding that will generate more objective and holistic descriptions of police-community interactions than provided by other existing 
methods., Co-principal investigator and member of the CSI team, Rachel Bailey, will deploy multiple metrics from interdisciplinary lenses in order to understand more accurately how officers are interacting with different publics in circumstances that are sometimes very stressful. Bailey is an assistant professor in the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication and director of the Communication Emotion and Cognition Laboratory at WSU., Other faculty and graduate students on the research team include Dale Willits, assistant professor of Criminal Justice and Criminology at WSU, and Bryce J. Dietrich, assistant professor of Social Science Informatics at the University of Iowa., The first-of-its kind CSI lab is funded by a $50,000WSU Grand Challenges Seed Grant aimed at advancing social justice and promoting an informed and equitable society. Further support comes from a National Institute of Justice grant awarded to WSU researchers to study the effects of legalized marijuana on law enforcement and crime in America., About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps and people that help law enforcement become smarter and safer.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., June 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- At the second annual Axon Accelerate User Conference, Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, previewed Axon Records, a groundbreaking RMS (records management system) designed to put officers back on the streets by reducing time spent doing paperwork while also helping agencies solve, prosecute and prevent crime. Axon Records will be available for law enforcement agencies to purchase in 2018., , At last year's IACP Conference in San Diego, Axon announced its efforts to reduce police paperwork by 80% within the next ten years. In pursuit of that goal, the company declared its intention to begin development on an RMS solution that seamlessly integrates with an agency's computer-aided dispatch system (CAD) and Axon's cloud-based digital evidence management solution, Evidence.com, thus making video of an incident the heart of the entire record. This will allow anyone with access to the video the ability to see and hear exactly what happened at the time of the incident., Less than a year later, Axon Records is well on its way to becoming a revolutionary solution in the world of RMS. Prior to offering a preview to attendees at the Accelerate User Conference, Axon worked with dozens of users spanning multiple major cities, state police and highway patrols, and large county sheriffs across the country to ensure the product is designed and built for end users' needs now and in the future. Axon has taken tremendous strides toward developing an RMS solution designed to be easily searchable, while offering tools for paperwork automation, effortless information sharing, and digital evidence integration. Agencies interested in getting their officers back on the streets can email records@axon.com to learn more about Axon Records and sign up to become a development partner., ""We've been hard at work developing this technology with a select few agencies, so taking the opportunity to share it with more than 500 Axon Accelerate attendees and thought leaders is a tremendous thrill,"" said Sayce Falk, Director of RMS. ""We've all seen how technology has helped accelerate certain aspects of our lives. In the 20th century, we used to read game highlights in a newspaper the day after. Today, we get immersive highlight reels as the game ends. Our vision for RMS is similar in that we're focused on delivering an integrative, multimedia platform that saves time and puts insights and the right information at every officer's fingertips."", Due in part to the proliferation of entering data into silo'd IT systems over the past several years, today's police officers often spend two-thirds of a given shift performing administrative tasks. While a certain amount of time spent on paperwork is unavoidable in the near term, Axon believes that outdated software prevents front-line officers from maximizing their time spent in their communities. Current RMS options often make integration with other technologies difficult, while giving agencies little support when it comes to easily accessing critical information on crime and incident trends. With the introduction of Axon Records, Axon plans to remedy that by promoting a fast, responsive system designed with the user in mind., About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer. Our mission is to protect life. Our technologies give law enforcement the confidence, focus and time they need to keep their communities safe. Our products impact every aspect of an officer's day-to-day experience:, We work hard for those who put themselves in harm's way for all of us. To date, there are more than 100,000 licensed users from around the world and more than 184,000 lives and countless dollars have been saved with the Axon network of devices, apps and people.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TASER International (Nasdaq: TASR), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, announced today that it is launching a new program to equip every police officer in America with a body camera and changing its name to Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN). It will also provide supporting hardware, software, data storage, training, and support to police departments free of cost for one year., Experience the interactive Multimedia News Release here: https://www.multivu.com/players/English/8012851-taser-rebrand-axon-free-body-cameras/, ""We are going 'all-in' to empower police officers to more safely and effectively do their jobs and drive important social change by making body cameras available to every officer in America,"" said Rick Smith, Founder and CEO of Axon. ""We believe these cameras are more than just tools to protect communities and the officers who serve them. They also hold the potential to change police work as we know it, by seamlessly collecting an impartial record and reducing the need for endless paperwork. That's why we're giving this opportunity to every single police officer in America."", Axon's development of body cameras, cloud solutions, and other technologies is, in part, a response to the changing nature of police work. A recent Pew Research Center study painted a stark portrait of 21st-century policing. Policing, the study concluded, is harder today than it has ever been. Police officers expressed serious concerns about limited resources, lack of staffing, and equipment issues. Axon believes that technology can help address these problems., ""Cameras are the first of many steps toward a future where officers feel more confident and are freed from mundane report writing to focus more time on community policing,"" said Smith. ""Ask any officer about what prevents them from spending more time in the community, they'll tell you it's because they spend the majority of their shift filling out forms, often by hand. In time, cameras combined with artificial intelligence will make that very manual process automatic and effortless by creating video records to replace manual forms. The faster we can get this technology to officers who need it, the faster we can begin that process and free up officers' time to get back into the community, building better relationships with the people they serve."", Axon is meeting the challenges officers face head-on. With this connected network of devices, apps, and people, officers can operate with confidence and focus on what matters: the people and community they serve. That's why Axon is giving every police officer in the United States access to its body-cam technology. The offer includes:, For additional information on how to sign up for the offer please visit: www.axon.com/offer. (This free, one-year trial offer is not available for any law enforcement agency or its officers in which Axon is participating in a request for proposal, a process that restricts communication with that agency or its officers.), This offer gives departments the chance to prove the benefits of body camera technology before investing taxpayer dollars in purchasing it. Procurement remains a cumbersome, uncertain process: Even as police work and technology has evolved, procurement can still rely on paperwork, presentations, and promises—not field testing by actual officers. So departments end up purchasing technology without the input of the people who use it every day, often with dismal results., Frontline officers are best positioned to evaluate and test this technology, and we encourage others in this space to give them that chance. Axon invites all providers of body cameras to join in this effort and provide free trial equipment for public safety agencies., ""The National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE) support the use of body cameras by police officers and have heard the call for their deployment from several communities demanding transparency. The offer from Axon is a bold move for the industry,"" says Perry Tarrant, National President of NOBLE. ""We believe body cameras offer a promising opportunity to increase transparency between police officers and the communities they serve."", Since its inception, the TASER name has become synonymous with iconic, less-lethal weapons. Today, the company's portfolio has grown to encompass a much wider range of technologies, including a rich ecosystem of connected devices and software applications., Smith added about the name change, ""Times are changing—and so are we. We are changing our name from TASER to Axon to reflect the evolution of our company from a less-lethal weapons manufacturing company to a full solutions provider of cloud and mobile software, connected devices, wearable cameras, and now artificial intelligence. Axon is the brand that reflects the network of devices, applications, and people that is transforming public safety. TASER will remain one of our flagship products, but now as a single focused product brand for our suite of Smart Weapons. Axon is the company we have become."", The new ticker symbol ""AAXN"" will become effective upon the opening of the Nasdaq market on April 6, 2017. The company's official website is now www.axon.com. Outstanding stock certificates will not be affected by the name change and will not need to be exchanged. All stock trading, filings and market-related information will be reported under the new corporate name and trading symbol., Management will host a conference call tonight, April 5, 2017 at 6:00 p.m. (ET) to provide further information to investors. To join the live audio call, please dial 877-303-9126 (domestic) or 253-237-1156 (international).

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, announced its new eXponential Stock Performance Plan (XSPP), a unique compensation plan that gives its employees a new opportunity to align their pay directly with value creation for shareholders., , Earlier this year, Axon's shareholders approved an innovative new compensation plan where Axon CEO Rick Smith relinquished his salary and future stock grants until 2028, in return for an approach that only pays the CEO upon delivering outsized returns. Now, Axon is allowing every employee to participate in a bold compensation plan aligned to the same milestones., ""I'm excited to align employees to my CEO compensation plan and give everyone at Axon the chance to capture the benefits of achieving the incredible goals we've set for the next decade,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""This new approach encourages a long-term view of the company and will reward our talent twofold: with the stable base compensation enabled at a profitable technology company, as well as with the outsized long-term rewards expected at a fast-growing startup."", ""In a time when many companies are concentrating equity grants only among the senior ranks, Axon's eXponential Stock Performance Plan is a bold, new approach to offering a meaningful share ownership opportunity to all employees and future recruits,"" said Jon Burg, a partner with Aon Equity Services, an industry-leading group specializing in employee ownership strategies. ""It combines the employee-friendly concepts of broad-based equity plans with rigorous, shareholder-friendly growth criteria, and a payout potential similar to the CEO's compensation program. Most important, it encourages employees to adopt a long-term outlook, and to drive hard to grow the company exponentially. Investors and the public should applaud Axon for their thoughtful and innovative approach to share ownership, motivation, and sound corporate governance."", ""The market for star tech talent is brutally competitive. Attracting and keeping the best talent, focused on developing solutions for law enforcement, is key to achieving Axon's long-term vision,"" said Hadi Partovi, chairman of the compensation committee for Axon's board of directors, and also CEO and founder of Code.org. ""Axon is keenly interested in attracting developers and product leaders who are excited to bring new product lines from 0 to 1. This caliber of talent is often attracted to the outsized potential returns of a startup, and this plan makes Axon more attractive among that talent pool. I believe that this plan will be a big win for both employees and shareholders."", The XSPP was developed with input from Axon's major shareholders, and awards under the XSPP will be subject to shareholder approval at a special meeting of shareholders, anticipated to be held in February of 2019. Axon's board of directors believes that the XSPP is in the best interest of Axon and its shareholders and recommends that Axon shareholders vote to approve the Axon Enterprise, Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the ""2019 Plan"") in order to facilitate the XSPP., How it WorksPursuant to the XSPP, all employees automatically receive a grant of 60 eXponential Stock Units (XSUs) under the 2019 Plan. Additionally, certain employees can allocate a portion of their future on-target earnings to be reassigned to additional XSUs. The number of XSUs an employee receives is based on a 3x risk multiplier, which is then multiplied by the 9 year length of the program. The total number of XSUs received by an employee is then divided evenly into 12 tranches that vest at similar thresholds to the 2018 CEO Performance Award. If Axon hits its targets outlined in the plan, employees will receive rewards that are aligned with exceptional returns for shareholders. To learn more about the XSPP, please visit www.axon.com/xspp-faq., Upcoming Shareholder VoteAlthough the Axon board of directors has approved the 2019 Plan and the XSPP, the effectiveness of the 2019 Plan and the XSU awards are subject to the approval of Axon's shareholders, who will be asked to approve the 2019 Plan at a special shareholder meeting that is currently expected to be held in February 2019. Anyone who is a shareholder of record or beneficial owner of Axon shares as of the record date (tentatively set for December 27, 2018) will be entitled to vote their shares at the special meeting and the 2019 Plan will only become effective if a majority of the votes cast are in favor of the proposal. If shareholder approval is not obtained at the special meeting, all XSU awards will automatically terminate and be forfeited. Axon has posted on its website and filed with the SEC a preliminary proxy statement (https://investor.axon.com/financials/sec-filings) providing details of the 2019 Plan and the XSPP along with additional materials for Axon shareholders., Additional Information and Where to Find ItAxon plans to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), and furnish to its shareholders a definitive proxy statement and other related materials in connection with the 2019 Plan (the ""Proxy Statement"") which is to be voted upon at a special meeting of shareholders (the ""Special Meeting""). The Proxy Statement will contain important information about the 2019 Plan and related matters. AXON'S SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND RELATED MATERIALS (INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS THERETO) AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT AXON WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT AXON, THE SPECIAL MEETING AND THE PLAN.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in public safety technology, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders. Results included:, Dear shareholders,, Axon's third quarter was highlighted by both innovation and execution. For the 25th anniversary of the company's founding, we were delighted to introduce the TASER 7 at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference in early October., TASER 7 is the first ground-up redesign of the TASER handheld weapon since the founding of the company in 1993. TASER 7 improves performance across all key metrics, increasing effectiveness, reducing size and improving ease of use. TASER 7 delivers a more compact multi-shot weapon, faster reloads, more stable darts with greater kinetic energy, and increased effectiveness yielding faster, more reliable threat stoppage. New adaptive cross connect technology actively measures and optimizes the flow of charge across up to four probes deployed on the target., TASER 7 is the most effective TASER weapon ever developed and represents a new premium tier in our weapons category that creates a compelling upgrade opportunity for our entire installed base. It also represents an important step toward our mission of making the bullet obsolete., Also, for the first time, the TASER 7 integrates seamlessly with our cloud-based software solution for Axon on-officer cameras without requiring a manual connection through a PC. Each TASER 7 is sold with a dock and subscription on Axon Evidence (Evidence.com). Law enforcement customers across the board tell us that TASER 7 is a game changer. It has already been ordered for full deployment by the Fort Worth Police Department and the Nevada State Highway Patrol and is in field trials with several other major agencies. We expect to begin meaningful shipments in December and will continue to sell prior models., In early October, we also introduced the Axon Body 3 camera, Axon's first LTE-connected device. Axon will procure embedded LTE services directly from FirstNet, built with AT&T, and Verizon's dedicated Public Safety Private Core, eliminating the need for agencies to handle the logistics of a separate LTE bill., Axon Body 3 retains all the features that made Axon Body 2 the market leader, including full-shift battery life, ruggedness, simplicity, and ease of use. Improvements include better low-light capture, higher image clarity, GPS functionality, and audio that allows for ambient noise reduction. Axon Body 3 also offers live-streaming video and the ability to react to active intelligence, with a processor that can handle edge-AI capabilities such as gunshot detection., Live streaming offers command staff real-time insight into what is happening during a major incident. In incidents such as mass shootings, bomb scares or SWAT team entries, command staff can see what the officers on the ground are seeing and can more expeditiously allocate the appropriate resources and inform the public. Also, we believe that arriving officers can perform better if they have enhanced situational awareness in advance., The timing of Axon Body 3's introduction was optimized for 2019 procurement cycles and to leverage the inflection point in adoption of FirstNet's and Verizon's mission-critical LTE services. Some agencies will receive test units in early 2019 and we expect shipments to begin ramping in mid-2019., In conjunction with revealing two new compelling hardware products — TASER 7 and Axon Body 3 — we also unveiled our go-to-market strategy for Axon Records, our new law enforcement records management system currently under development. In short, Axon is disrupting how agency records management systems are packaged and sold. Agencies that procure the TASER 7 and Axon Body 3 via our Officer Safety Plan package will receive Axon Records' core functionality at no incremental cost for five years. Because records management systems represent one of the largest technology costs for agencies, we believe this offering provides us with a significant competitive advantage., Axon Records remains on track to be commercially available in Q3 2019, with deployments beginning to scale at that time. We are building a foundational product, upon which we will incorporate additional modules and apps over time, including transcription and automatic report writing. Axon Records will support the key functions that agencies require, including incident report writing, case management, routing and task management, and Axon Evidence integration., Making Axon Records available for free as part of our popular Officer Safety Plan is a strategy designed to rapidly drive mass adoption. Combining agencies' text records with on-officer camera data puts video at the heart of the record and creates the ecosystem for us to develop breakthrough premium services, leveraging our industry-leading AI team. Axon Records creates the training data set to enable us to develop AI models that extract the records meta data from the audio-video data. The value created by automating the incident report creation process will be far greater than the value of any records system currently in existence., Summary of Q3 2018 Results (1), , (1) Amounts for Q3 2017 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of Topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under ASC 605.

We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps, and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer.

Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Words such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""predict,"" ""potential,"" ""continue,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""future,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words., We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: customer purchase behavior, including adoption of our software as a service delivery model; our exposure to cancellations of government contracts due to appropriation clauses, exercise of a cancellation clause, or non-exercise of contractually optional periods; our ability to design, introduce and sell new products or features; our ability to manage our supply chain and avoid production delays or shortages; changes in the costs of product components and labor; defects in our products; the impact of product mix on projected gross margins; loss of customer data, a breach of security or an extended outage, including our reliance on third party cloud-based storage providers; negative media publicity regarding our products; our ability to defend against litigation and protect our intellectual property, and the resulting costs of this activity; changes in government regulations in the U.S. and in foreign markets, especially related to the classification of our product by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; counter-party risks relating to cash balances held in excess of FDIC insurance limits; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; and our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. The Annual Report on Form 10-K that we filed with the SEC on March 1, 2018 listed various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These factors are intended as cautionary statements for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Readers can find them under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in the Report on Form 10-K and in the Report on Form 10-Q, and investors should refer to them. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties., Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC., Please visit http://investor.axon.com, https://www.axon.com/press, www.twitter.com/axon_us and https://www.facebook.com/Axon.ProtectLife/ where Axon discloses information about the company, its financial information, and its business., For investor relations information please contact Andrea James via email at IR@axon.com., AXON ENTERPRISE, INC., CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, (Unaudited), (in thousands, except per share data), Three Months Ended, Nine Months Ended September 30,, September 30, 2018, June 30,, 2018, September 30,

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Aug. 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in public safety technology, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders. Results included:, Dear shareholders,, We made significant progress this past quarter in building out the Axon network. We added key capabilities through new partnerships with DJI and Milestone Systems, bringing drone and CCTV compatibility to our network. We also announced Axon Fleet 2, our second generation in-car video system, which builds upon the momentum of Axon Fleet. By Q4 of last year, Axon Fleet became the number one in-car video system in the U.S. by order volume according to our win-loss analysis, and we continue to vie for the top spot each quarter. Axon Fleet demonstrates the power of the Axon network to drive success in new segments where the network effects of seamless integration create highly valuable and unique differentiation. We hope to see similar results with Axon Records, our next major initiative, which has begun field testing with a partner agency. We have also staffed a team and begun development of Axon Dispatch, the next major cloud software system that will follow Records. Finally, we expanded our user base with the acquisition of VIEVU, and ended the quarter with over 300,000 booked seats., Our product pipeline is key to delivering upon our long-term growth objectives. We continue to scale our research and development organization, with significant progress building out our engineering team year-to-date. We discuss more product development milestones, and what our teams are working on, below., The market appears to be validating our approach. In July, Honolulu became the 45th major city to join the Axon network with the order of 1,200 body cameras and unlimited storage on Evidence.com. And our international customer momentum continues. In July, Alberta'sCalgary Police Service became the first major city in Canada to join the Axon network, and in June, the Cumbria Constabulary became the first UK law enforcement agency to roll out Axon Citizen, our public evidence submission tool., In June, we hosted our annual Axon Accelerate user conference in Scottsdale. In three years, we've built the largest technology conference in policing, which immerses chiefs, public information officers, prosecutors, officers and media in the Axon network for 48 hours. More than 1,100 law enforcement personnel attended the conference, representing significant growth compared with 400 attendees last year. We also attracted several large sponsors, including Microsoft. More importantly, so far we've seen Axon Accelerate customer leads become nearly as large as those that we generate at The International Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference. As we continue to build Axon Accelerate, we expect it to become the preeminent tech conference in public safety., Planning also continues for our next generation manufacturing facility in Scottsdale, which would consolidate four office locations into one building and bring more automation to future generations of product hardware. Production of our current hardware product suite is highly manual — less than 50% of part manufacturing is automated. We have plans to automate more than 75% of future hardware production., Finally, in the second quarter we completed a successful follow-on offering of common shares, raising gross proceeds of $246 million. The offering strengthened Axon's financial position, providing us with enhanced flexibility as we transition more of our product sales to subscription pricing models, while also enabling us to continue investing for growth., For those shareholders new to Axon, we are investing in four strategic growth areas, which we believe represent the future of critical public safety technology:, These value streams exist within an estimated $7.7 billion total addressable market, comprising TASER weapons ($1.5 billion), hardware sensors ($0.7 billion), and cloud-based public safety software ($5.5 billion.), We are focused on building highly defensible subscription revenue models that are expected to provide stable and consistent recurring revenue, and developing software that generates network effects that will add to the stability of our recurring revenue streams., Summary of Q2 2018 Results (1), (1) Amounts for Q2 2017 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of Topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under ASC 605. Revenue for Q2 2018 would have been $98.6 million under ASC 605., , Financial Commentary by Segment, TASER Weapons, Three Months Ended, Change, June 30,, 2018, March 31,, 2018, June 30,, 2017 (1), QoQ, YoY, TASER Weapons, Net sales, $, 60,624, $, 63,524, $, 53,016, (4.6)%, 14.4, %, Gross margin, 70.8, %, 67.7, %, 69.7, %, 310bp, 110bp, (1) Amounts for the three months ended June 30, 2017 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of Topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under ASC 605., , , , Software & Sensors, Three Months Ended, Change, June 30,, 2018, March 31,, 2018, June 30,, 2017 (1), QoQ, YoY, Software and Sensors, Axon Cloud net sales, $, 22,505, $, 20,241, $, 12,768, 11.2, %, 76.3, %, Axon Cloud gross margin, 77.8, %, 78.7, %, 70.0, %, -90bp, 780bp, Sensors and Other net sales, $, 16,097, $, 17,450, $, 13,859, (7.8)%, 16.1, %, Sensors and Other gross margin, 16.7, %, 31.9, %, (1.7)%, -1,520bp, 1,840bp, (1) Amounts for the three months ended June 30, 2017 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of Topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under ASC 605., Updates on our Product Pipeline:, Axon Fleet - This summer, we launched Axon Fleet 2, which offers substantial hardware improvements over Axon Fleet, including high-definition video with a wide field of view, zoom capability, infrared for the back seat camera, and wireless microphone integration so that no important sounds are lost. We expect the first Axon Fleet 2 units to begin shipping soon., Evidence.com - We are driving higher average revenue per user for new Evidence.com sign-ups as our cloud-based software continues to add capability. What was once simply a tool for storing and managing body camera video has now expanded to store multiple types of evidence data, including body camera footage, CCTV footage, drone footage, and citizen-submitted photo and video evidence. In Q2, we strategically partnered with Milestone Systems, a world-leading open platform IP video management software provider. The partnership with Milestone brings data from more than 6,000 models of cameras from 150 manufacturers, including CCTV footage, into Evidence.com. Data that is stored in Evidence.com is secure, trackable, easily shareable, and redactable., Axon is also making it easier than ever for law enforcement agencies to ingest CCTV camera footage. The old method included burning video to a DVD and physically handing the disc to detectives. With our technology, footage can get pushed to Evidence.com via our new integration with Milestone, or collected from just about anywhere via the Axon Citizen mobile upload tool., Average revenue per user dipped slightly in Q2 on a sequential basis due to the integration of VIEVU's customers and contracts. That said, in Q2 2018, we saw new customer sign ups at higher ARPUs than Q2 2017 and we feel confident in our ability to grow ARPU over the long-term as Evidence.com's value proposition expands with added features., Axon Records - Axon Records remains in its pre-revenue investment phase, although it is now transitioning into field testing. We are working toward refining a best-in-class officer interface, and ensuring that our reporting function is scalable and customizable. Beyond incident reporting capability, we are also building out crime analysis, records review capability, and investigations and case tracking., As noted earlier, we are field testing the first iteration of Axon Records with a partner law enforcement agency. The Axon Records pilot ties into the agency's existing records management system, providing a seamless experience for this first partner agency and allowing us to build capability incrementally, and iterate and test quickly. The pilot's capability suite is a subset of the more robust system we are building, which in the future will include body camera transcription and automated report writing assisted by artificial intelligence and machine learning., Initial feedback from officers using our product has been positive — we are already helping save time writing incident reports. We hope to go live with two more development partners by the end of 2018. These development partners would serve as our initial reference accounts once the product goes to market., We are aiming for a generally available product in mid-2019 that would fulfill the needs of most US law enforcement agencies, and offer a far superior user experience. We have identified a pipeline of agencies that are interested in becoming customers. Hiring engineering talent remains a key area of focus and execution. Given the amount of customer research and feedback we have undertaken, we feel confident about the specific feature sets we are choosing to develop., To recap, Axon Records is our technology solution that will reduce the time officers spend writing reports so they can spend more time policing. Modern police record-keeping is fundamentally about gathering the evidence associated with an event and transferring it to a prosecutor to use in the court system. Axon's market-leading body camera data management solution, Evidence.com, is highly valuable because digital video evidence is often critically important to the larger incident record. Axon Records will build out our existing software ecosystem by integrating body camera video with other incident data, streamlining and using the body camera to assist in reporting, and allow records to be securely stored in our cloud, shared and redacted., Artificial Intelligence (AI) & Machine Learning (ML) - Deploying AI and ML tools to the public safety sector requires areas of investment that are often not required in the civilian or consumer sectors, which is why we are seeing the benefits of specializing on the public safety vertical. In Q2, Axon opened the industry's first center for AI training on public safety data, which we designed in compliance with the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy. Customer agencies must opt-in to share data with our center, which has a heightened level of security. Our AI solutions include developing software to automate redaction, to enable vehicle, speech and critical event recognition, speech transcription, automatic license plate recognition, and automated data analysis. For critical event recognition, we are developing an AI solution to detect officers' actions, such as foot chases, which could help notify other officers that a critical event is unfolding. Axon formed its AI research team in February 2017 after acquiring two AI research and engineering teams, Dextro and Misfit (previously part of Fossil Group, Inc.)., Axon Air - We launched Axon Air in June at our annual user conference, Axon Accelerate. Under an exclusive partnership, within the digital evidence management industry, with DJI, the world's leader in civilian drones and aerial imaging technology, we can sell DJI drones directly to public safety and law enforcement agencies worldwide. More than 900 public safety agencies use drones to support tactical actions, reconstruct traffic collisions, observe large events, and perform search and rescue. Through Axon Air, law enforcement agencies can purchase DJI drone technology directly from Axon, which has strong customer relationships in law enforcement and expertise in agency contracting. Camera footage from the drones can be safely stored and managed in Axon's cloud, Evidence.com. Axon's software and sales teams are also supporting law enforcement agencies in managing their drone programs. We are developing a long-term software roadmap to add drone specific advanced features that will create unique capabilities for our customers., Outlook:, We are providing the following updated guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2018:, We believe we have the right vision for the future of law enforcement, and we are committed to superior execution against our plans., Signed,, Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST:, We will host our Q2 2018 earnings conference call on Tuesday, August 7, 2018 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., To join the live audio call, please dial 877-303-9126 (domestic) or +1-253-237-1156 (international) and use conference ID number 9995809., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at http://investor.axon.com., Statistical Definitions, Software & Sensors bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software & Sensors hardware, software and Evidence.com. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps, and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in public safety technology, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders., , Dear shareholders,, Axon is executing upon its mission of saving lives and enabling fair and effective public safety and we continue to grow in relevance to the police agency customers we serve. Our strong Q1 2018 revenue and profit reflect our laser focus on execution across all aspects of our business., Last week, we announced the strategic acquisition of VIEVU from The Safariland Group. The purchase price consisted of $4.6 million in cash and $2.5 million in common stock issued to Safariland at closing. Deal terms also include consideration of up to approximately 141,000 shares of common stock, contingent upon achieving certain milestones over the next two years, as well as minimum holster purchases. The transaction adds five major city customers and hundreds of smaller agencies to Axon's customer base. The majority of VIEVU's employees are based in Seattle and are expected to be integrated into Axon's Seattle office., To recap, our strategic growth areas are TASER weapons, Sensors hardware including on-officer body cameras and Axon Fleet in-car video systems, our Evidence.com connected software network and Axon Records and Computer Aided Dispatch software. On the bottom line, we are right-sizing our investments to match the opportunity set and continuing to work toward delivering break-even operating margins in our Software & Sensors segment by the end of 2020., In June, we will host Axon Accelerate, our third-annual user conference that is quickly becoming the premier law enforcement technology conference and trade show. We're very pleased with our progress and the interest we see from our customers in adopting our new products. We expect Axon Accelerate attendance to triple over last year as public safety's best and brightest engage in a symposium of thought-leadership blended with hands-on training., Summary of Q1 2018 Results(1):, (1) Amounts for Q1 2017 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of Topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under ASC 605. Revenue for Q1 2018 would have been $99.5 million under ASC 605., TASER Weapons:, We are seeing sustained demand for TASER weapons driven by three primary factors., First, we are seeing a trend toward full deployments with US law enforcement agencies. Customers are shortening their upgrade cycles to five years from eight years, encouraged by our TASER 60 five-year payment plan and our Officer Safety Plan, which combines our body cameras and cloud software with a TASER handle. In Q1 2018, about 40% of TASER unit orders were on a service plan., Second, we are seeing strong international demand, including encouraging developments in several European markets. The Italian government, for instance, is in the process of legalizing the TASER weapon for widespread use and Axon expects TASER X2 trials to begin soon in Milan, Brindisi, Caserta, Catania, Padua, and Reggio Emilia. Additionally, we are starting TASER trials in Germany and see a strong pipeline in the UK., Lastly, we are expanding our customer base into adjacent markets. In 2017, for example, domestic law enforcement represented about 74% of TASER weapons sales, by handle unit volume (excluding cartridges). Other segments included international law enforcement (13%), US federal agencies (6%), university offices of public safety (2%), departments of corrections (1%) and private security and other non-law enforcement agencies (4%)., We continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property. In April, a Florida federal district court ruled in favor of Axon against PhaZZer Electronics, Inc. for its willful infringement of Axon's patent and trademark rights concerning its sale of the PhaZZer Enforcer CEW and probe cartridges. We previously obtained CEW patent infringement injunctions against Stinger Systems in 2010 and Karbon Arms in 2014., Software & Sensors:, We've been very active in our Software & Sensors segment and we're pleased with our Q1 results., Operational highlights since our last quarterly update include the purchase of VIEVU; the commencement of camera shipments to the Victoria Police in Australia, which represents our second largest body camera unit deployment after the London Metropolitan Police; significant orders from the UK'sKent and Essex police forces; and reaching full deployment in the Chicago Police Department with around 7,000 body-worn cameras., Product Pipeline:, Evidence.com - In February, we successfully rolled out Redaction Studio to Evidence.com customers in the US, Australia, Canada and the UK. The software capability helps users to more easily redact video, solving a giant pain point for our customers. Redaction Studio has already been a determining factor in competitive RFPs, helping agencies to select Axon as their body camera provider. It is included within our Pro software licensing tier., Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning - We are taking a smart and strategic approach to the use of AI and ML in policing technology. We are cognizant of the concerns around privacy rights and the risks associated with the use of AI technology. Accordingly, we recently announced the formation of a transparent AI Ethics Board to help ensure we balance both the risks and benefits of deploying this technology., Axon Records - Our Axon Records engineering and design teams in Seattle are making progress against 2018 product milestones, including introducing report writing capability to our development partner agencies., To recap, Axon Records is our technology solution that will reduce the time officers spend writing reports so they can spend more time policing. Modern police record-keeping is fundamentally about gathering the evidence associated with an event and transferring it to a prosecutor to use in the court system. Axon's market-leading body camera data management solution, Evidence.com, is highly valuable because digital video evidence is often critically important to the larger incident record. Axon Records builds out our existing software ecosystem by marrying body camera video with other incident data, streamlining and using the body camera to assist in reporting, and allowing records to be securely stored and shared beyond the agency., Axon Records remains in its pre-revenue investment phase. We have a robust team of developers in our Seattle office who have deployed the solution with several police agency development partners, which are running early iterations of the product. We believe Axon Records expands our total addressable market by more than $2 billion., Outlook:, We are providing the following updated guidance for the full year ending December 31, 2018:, We look forward to providing more details on our quarterly earnings call this afternoon and updating you on our progress throughout the year., Signed,Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST:, We will host our Q1 2018 earnings conference call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., To join the live audio call, please dial 877-303-9126 (domestic) or +1-253-237-1156 (international) and use conference ID number 2962109., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at http://investor.axon.com., We have posted to our website supplemental materials including key operating metrics and additional information at http://investor.axon.com/events-and-presentations., Statistical Definitions:, Software & Sensors bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software & Sensors hardware, software and Evidence.com. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures:, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EPS, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented at the end of the release., Adjusted EPS is defined as the tax-adjusted earnings per share excluding the costs of non-cash stock-based compensation and excluding certain other items, including net gain/loss on write-down/disposal/abandonment of property, equipment and intangible assets; and loss on impairment., EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is defined as EBITDA before certain other items, including: stock-based compensation; net gain/loss on write-down/disposal/abandonment of property, equipment and intangible assets; and loss on impairment., Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, today announced that a Florida federal district court has ruled in favor of Axon against PhaZZer Electronics, Inc. for its willful infringement of Axon's patent and trademark rights concerning its sale of the PhaZZer Enforcer CEW (conducted electrical weapon) and probe cartridges., , The award follows the court's judgment and permanent injunction issued in July 2017 prohibiting PhaZZer from making, using, offering for sale, selling, donating, distributing, importing, or exporting the Enforcer CEW and associated cartridges. The court's ruling makes clear that all Enforcer CEWs are covered by the ban, whether or not they have dataports., ""We aggressively enforce our intellectual property rights and have a proven track record of success in litigating these cases,"" says Axon General Counsel Doug Klint. ""Willful infringement of our weapons technology will never be tolerated and we will not allow competitors to trade on Axon's innovation, goodwill and reputation for quality."", Axon previously obtained CEW patent infringement injunctions against Stinger Systems in 2010 and Karbon Arms in 2014., Axon's patent (U.S. No. 7,234,262) at issue in the litigation (Case No. 6:16-cv-00366-PGB-KRS) relates to the CEW's data recording of date and time of each trigger operation and duration of the stimulus. Axon's trademark, Federal Registration No. 4,423,789, relates to the non-functional shape of TASER CEW cartridges used to launch the probes., PhaZZer's pending appeal in the Federal Circuit focuses primarily on the scope of the trademark injunction relating to CEW cartridges. PhaZZer lost its bid in both the district court and the Federal Circuit to suspend the injunction during the appeal, despite its claims of insolvency. The injunction remains in full force and effect., PhaZZer has twice attempted to invalidate the '262 patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Its first reexamination challenge failed (No. 90/013,770 filed June 25, 2016). On April 18, 2017, the USPTO confirmed the patentability of claims 6-18 as originally issued, including claim 13 involved in the litigation. Claims 1-5 were found patentable as amended., PhaZZer then filed a second reexamination petition on April 27, 2017 (No. 90/013,945). On April 2, 2018, the patent examiner rejected all claims of the '262 patent, finding them obvious based on an unusual 3-patent prior art combination involving a firearm, CEW and pepper spray. This decision, however, is simply a procedural step in the reexamination process that does not invalidate the patent. The '262 patent remains enforceable throughout the completion of the administrative proceeding and potential appeals within the USPTO, and if necessary, with the Federal Circuit. ""We believe the examiner's positions to be legally and factually incorrect, and that the validity of the challenged claims will ultimately be confirmed,"" concluded Klint., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps, and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer.

/*--><!]]>*/, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in public safety technology, today announced a ten-year CEO performance award for CEO and founder Rick Smith tied entirely to achieving market cap and financial performance milestones that would make Axon one of the most valuable companies in the public safety sector. For the award to fully vest, Axon's market cap would have to grow ten-fold from recent levels to $13.5 billion, and key revenue and profitability goals would also have to be achieved. The award is modeled after the recently announced 2018 Tesla CEO compensation plan for Elon Musk, which the New York Times described as ""about as friendly to shareholders as they come."", Under this performance award, Rick will only be compensated if Axon generates extraordinary shareholder value. He will not receive a salary or cash bonus, nor any new equity compensation that vests automatically with the passage of time., ""Today's announcement bolsters Axon's bold ten-year vision for growth, innovation, and social change with a compensation plan that inspires and motivates,"" said Hadi Partovi, Axon Board member and CEO of Code.org. ""In every technology company I've backed, the long-term vision and drive of the founder/CEO has played a critical role. Axon's plan ensures that Rick is fully committed for the long haul, with outstanding incentives to deliver outstanding results."", CEO Performance Award Details, The performance award consists of a ten-year grant of stock options that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair of milestones are both met., , , By combining market cap, revenue, and EBITDA milestones, Rick is motivated to generate long-term value for shareholders through delivering operational results, without incentives to engage in short-term measures., For each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Rick will vest in 538,488 stock option shares (corresponding to 1% of Axon's current outstanding shares). If none of the market cap or financial performance objectives are achieved, Rick will receive no compensation., Leading Axon's Mission to Protect Life While Driving Growth and Profitability, Rick has been instrumental to Axon's market leadership in less lethal weapons, body cameras, and evidence management software. Axon has an even bolder vision for the next ten years: to make the bullet obsolete, and to enhance transparency in our justice systems ensuring fair, effective justice for all., Our weapons have saved 196,000 lives and are broadly used by law enforcement worldwide. Rick's personal goal is to launch a TASER weapon that can outperform a lethal handgun within the next decade, offering a new solution to the problems of gun violence, which are painfully highlighted by recent events., Our wearable cameras and cloud services have transformed public safety, bringing the light of transparency to corners of society where brave men and women confront dangers most of us never see. We plan to revolutionize this sector further with artificial intelligence technology to help law enforcement save time and save lives., Rick remains Axon's largest individual shareholder, and today's award (which is contingent on his continued leadership) ensures his commitment and focus on delivering on a ten-year vision that can increase shareholder value., Modeled After the 2018 Tesla CEO Compensation Plan, Upon reviewing the recently-announced Tesla CEO compensation plan, the Axon Board was impressed with the design of the plan to maximize alignment with shareholders while accounting for future unforeseen events. The Tesla plan stood out because it represents 100% pay-for-performance, motivates a long-term commitment, and aligns CEO compensation with value creation for all stakeholders, including employees, customers and shareholders., Consequently, the Axon Board has mindfully endeavored to mirror the Tesla plan with deviations only where it felt Axon's circumstances are different. Rick's performance award is structurally similar to the Tesla plan, with numbers adjusted for Axon's scale, business model, and objectives. Axon's Compensation Committee engaged Compensia Inc., Aon Equity Services and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati — the same external compensation and legal experts who assisted Tesla in creating its plan, as well as the law firm of Snell & Wilmer. Readers will note this press release, and the upcoming proxy statement, are similar in format to the Tesla plan documentation. This is intentional, to help any shareholders, analysts and other parties who have invested time to 
understand Elon Musk's plan to more easily understand the Axon CEO award., Upcoming Shareholder Vote, The Board granted this award to Rick on February 26, 2018 with Rick recusing himself, and its effectiveness is subject to the approval of Axon's shareholders, who will vote on it at the Axon Annual Stockholder meeting on May 24. Rick Smith will also recuse himself from that vote., Any shareholder of record or beneficial owner of Axon shares as of the record date (currently projected to be March 26, 2018) will be entitled to vote their shares at the 2018 Annual Meeting and the award will only become effective if a majority of the votes cast are in favor of the proposal. Axon will release its full proxy statement providing complete details of the award along with additional materials for Axon shareholders in the next few weeks., Proxy Statement Information, Axon plans to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), and furnish to its shareholders a proxy statement in connection with the proposed CEO performance award. This proxy statement will contain important information about the proposed award and related matters. AXON SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT AXON WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT AXON AND THE CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD. Shareholders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents and other documents filed with the SEC by Axon through the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. In addition, shareholders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents from Axon's 
Investor Relations page at http://investor.axon.com., The directors and executive officers of Axon may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from the stockholders of Axon in connection with the CEO Performance Award. The following directors and executive officers of Axon are participants in the solicitation: Directors Michael Garnreiter, Hadi Partovi, Mark W. Kroll, Dr. Richard Carmona, Bret Taylor, Matthew McBrady, and Julie Anne Cullivan, as well as Patrick W. Smith, Director and CEO, Luke S. Larson, President, Jawad Ahsan, Chief Financial Officer, Douglas E. Klint, General Counsel, and Josh M. Isner, Chief Revenue Officer. None of such participants owns in excess of 1% of the Company's common stock except for 
Patrick Smith, who beneficially owns 2.4% of the Company's outstanding common stock. Additional information regarding the interests of participants in the solicitation of proxies in respect of the Annual Meeting will be included in the Proxy Statement., Forward-Looking Statements, Certain statements herein, including statements regarding future development plans, are forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially, including the risks identified in our SEC filings.

/*--><!]]>*/, , SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in public safety technology, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders., , , Dear shareholders,, Today we are reporting our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 and we are providing our 2018 outlook., We've just completed a pivotal year where we changed our company name from TASER International to Axon Enterprise (Axon) to better reflect our go-forward mission and made significant investments to drive progress within our four strategic growth areas: 1) TASER conducted electric weapons (CEWs), 2) body-worn cameras and evidence management, 3) Axon Fleet in-car video systems, and 4) Axon Records. We also made investments in our international direct sales strategy and artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities., We don't intend to slow down in 2018. At our Investor & Analyst day in November 2017, we laid out a financial strategy to shift to recurring cash flows, to invest in products and features that expand our total addressable market and to drive profitability through disciplined execution., This year, we plan to introduce several new products and services and improve upon our existing suite of offerings  - which we believe will grow recurring cash flows and increase average revenue per user. We're also scaling up our offices across the world and cross-pollinating our internal groups to ensure we execute against one vision for Axon. In short, we are focused on disciplined execution and preparing for significant growth across the globe., Finally, we are driving toward profitability in the Software & Sensors segment and remain committed to expanding total company operating margins, which we address in more detail below., Summary of Q4 2017 Results:, TASER Weapons:, In Q4 2017, approximately 38% of units ordered, including from international customers, were on the TASER 60, Officer Safety Plan, or TASER Assurance Plan payment options. This compares to the 43% of weapons sold on a payment plan in Q3 2017, which indicates our customers continued willingness to pay for weapons hardware via payment plan and supports our stated financial goal of increasing recurring cash flows., Two of our top three TASER contracts signed in Q4 2017 were procured via the TASER 60 payment plan. We're also seeing increased adoption of our TASER X2 two-shot CEW, proving that customers see value in having an immediate backup shot., Looking forward, our TASER weapons sales pipeline remains solid, reflecting continued strong demand domestically and increasing interest across international markets. We believe that continued investments in smart weapons technology and incident reporting will further enhance our value proposition over the long term., Software & Sensors:, In early December 2017 we completed the migration of the U.S. instance of Evidence.com to Microsoft Azure. We announced the strategic decision to switch to Microsoft Azure in Q4 2015, with the goal of better aligning our cloud-hosted services with our customer preferences. We believe that ours was the largest application ever to migrate between two public cloud providers. Throughout the migration, we focused on the three priorities of correctness, minimal impact to customers and security. Preserving the integrity and privacy of our customers' evidence data continues to be our highest priority., Although the initiative spanned two years and thousands of hours of work, the switch on a Sunday morning in early December required only one hour of downtime and resulted in no reported application bugs, nor security or compliance issues for our customers. This smooth transition highlights our team's competence and subject matter expertise in site reliability engineering, software engineering, product management, information security, and customer support engineering., Importantly, our partnership with Microsoft is already generating positive results, helping us win several major city police agencies in the U.S. and one large international customer. The partnership will also allow us to reduce our storage and server costs going forward., We incurred a total of $0.7 million of migration and duplicate storage cost in Q4 2017 compared with our projection of $1.0 million for the quarter and our Q3 2017 incurred costs of $1.4 million., Unit shipments also reflect some large deployments that pushed into Q1 2018. Q1 2018 is already off to a strong start for new orders. Australia'sVictoria Police will deploy 11,000 body cameras backed by Evidence.com, which will represent our second largest body camera deployment., We recorded 13 competitor conversion wins in Q4 2017 where our body-worn camera or Axon Fleet offering displaced a competitor, bringing our 2017 total to 46 customer conversions. In Q4 2017, we recorded 11 expansions where a state or major city police agency chose to upsize their contracts and expand their reliance upon the Axon network., Independent research reports continue to validate the benefits of body camera technology. In Q4 2017, an independent study was published showing that use-of-force complaints fell 37% at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) after the agency deployed Axon body-worn cameras. Researchers also performed a cost-benefit analysis and found that body-worn cameras could ultimately save LVMPD up to $4 million per year in legal fees. The study was conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and CNA, a non-profit research and analysis organization, and was funded by the U.S. Department of Justice., As of December 31, 2017, 37 of the 69 U.S. major city law enforcement agencies had purchased Axon body-worn cameras or our digital evidence management solution: Albuquerque, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Baltimore County, Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Fort Worth, Fresno, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Louisville, Memphis, Mesa, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Montgomery County, New Orleans, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Tampa, Tucson, Washington DC, and Wichita., Axon's Evidence.com platform user count continued to grow, extending our market leadership. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we booked approximately 14,100 seats on our digital evidence management platform, Evidence.com, net of renewals. Since inception, we have booked cumulative Evidence.com licenses of approximately 201,500., Product Pipeline:, Evidence.com - Evidence.com is a revolutionary way to manage digital evidence and the platform continues to expand its use cases. In fact, among agencies that are not yet ready to deploy body cameras, we are starting to see interest in Evidence.com products, including Axon Capture, which enables officers to capture evidence using their mobile phone cameras. Looking ahead, we see a significant opportunity to sell our software to agencies who are not using Axon hardware., We are pleased to note that the new redaction studio capabilities we rolled out in Q4 2017 are being met with positive reception from our early access program customers. One police agency redaction specialist told us, ""The Studio is a vast improvement on redaction! The object tracker works great, and when it misses, it's easy to realign. Spray Paint is super as well! I am so glad we have this new tool, once we get the hang of it well, it's going to be awesome, it already is! Thank you again."", Also, we are enhancing Evidence.com to make it easier for departments to ingest CCTV footage, which is currently a large pain point for our customers. Agencies want to put all forms of video into Evidence.com to take advantage of its advanced capabilities, such as sharing with detectives and prosecutors, as well as allowing videos to be redacted., Axon Citizen - Axon Citizen, the public evidence submission tool that we announced in Q4 2017, is also receiving positive feedback from early access agencies. Axon Citizen allows members of the community to use their mobile phones to send evidence directly to departments. It's exciting for us to watch agency customers take ownership of the tool and inform their own constituencies about their efforts to make communities safer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZQYZTKli4. In Q4, Axon Citizen helped with its first arrest after officers in an East Coast agency used the tool to allow a burglary victim to send videos of the suspect., Without Axon Citizen, if a member of the community has evidence on a mobile phone, the officer has to confiscate the phone for a week or longer to obtain the data. Officers also receive photos from the public via e-mail, which means the photo evidence lacks the audit trails required by law to be admissible in court and lacks meta-data to tie it to a specific case. Axon Citizen solves these problems by allowing an officer to text a secure link to victims and eye-witnesses, who can upload evidence to the department via Axon's secure cloud-based system., We're planning to launch a community-wide public evidence submission tool in mid-2018 that will allow departments to more easily manage evidence related to larger scale crimes, such as missing persons, shootings, bombings, or natural disasters., Camera Hardware - We also continue to invest in and improve our camera hardware. In February, we opened a small R&D office in Tampere, Finland, the country's second largest metropolitan area. A new team of world-renowned imaging experts (formerly the Nokia camera imaging team) have begun working on our next-generation body camera and Axon Fleet hardware. This added team is budget-neutral relative to the three-year plan we laid out at our November 2017 Investor & Analyst Day., Signal Sidearm - We have been improving and fine tuning our Signal Sidearm offering, which signals Axon cameras to begin recording after an officer removes a firearm from its holster. We're presently rolling out new functionality, which includes eliminating the production of nuisance videos generated when firearms are pulled in training or for reasons that don't include an intention to shoot., Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning - We are applying AI, machine learning and data science to common policing problems and eliminating pain points for agencies. Our AI investments in 2018 will span our product sets, including AI services at the edge (within devices) and in the cloud., Axon Records - Axon Records remains an important area of focus and investment. We are continuing to hire new software engineering talent to help us build the next generation of policing software. Our 2018 product milestone targets include launching our records management system (RMS) with select agencies. We are also actively collecting feedback from our development partners, who are running early iterations of Axon Records. We plan to deploy video-based incident report writing capability in the second half of 2018 to our early access partners., Our customer facing team is already engaged in pre-sales activities to support the launch of Axon Records later this year., Full Year 2018 Outlook:, For the full year ending December 31, 2018, we expect to achieve the following:, We remain confident in our goal of providing the premier end-to-end technology solution for law enforcement. We believe we are demonstrating the ability to morph from a hardware-only business into a subscription-hardware-plus-SAAS-solutions-and-enterprise-software company, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2018., Signed,Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST:, The Company will host its Q4 2017 earnings conference call on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET. To join the live audio presentation, please dial toll free 877-303-9126, or for international callers, please dial+1-253-237-1156., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at http://investor.axon.com/., The Company has posted supplemental materials including its key operating metrics on its website to provide additional information about our fourth quarter financial results., Statistical Definitions:, Bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software & Sensors hardware, software and Evidence.com. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures:, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented at the end of the release., EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is defined as EBITDA before certain other items, including: stock-based compensation; net gain/loss on write-down/disposal/abandonment of property, equipment and intangible assets; and loss on impairment., Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, The Axon network is a network of devices, apps and people that helps law enforcement become smarter and safer. Our mission is to protect life. Our technologies give law enforcement the confidence, focus and time they need to keep their communities safe.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 7, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders., , Dear Shareholders,, Since our August update, we executed on a series of objectives across our product, people, and adjacent markets, and we feel as confident as ever in our strategy and trajectory. We set and delivered on several large goals thus far in 2019 — all with the purpose of driving adoption of our growing software platform, transforming Axon into the leading technology provider for public safety, and serving our ultimate goal of creating safer communities and protecting life., Importantly, we continue to make substantial progress driving long-term subscriptions. Customers have been rapidly adopting our best-value plans to gain access to more of the Axon network, building upon our historical strength with TASER device and body camera solution subscriptions. Our highest value tiered integrated bundle, for example, of $199 per officer per month over five years, known as the Officer Safety Plan, includes access to a wide range of benefits including TASER 7, Axon Body 3, and a host of cloud services including Axon Records. In Q3 2019, about a third of our total quarterly bookings, which average about five years per contract, were tied to some version of the Officer Safety Plan., We are thrilled to be approaching year end with a strong market position and powerful operating platform that will support the next several years of revenue and profit growth., Product, We have a number of positive updates across our product portfolio., After completing carrier certification with AT&T FirstNet Ready™ and Verizon Responder Private Core, we began shipping Axon Body 3, our latest generation camera, in September, as planned. Axon Body 3's cellular communication, wireless data, and geolocation capabilities are poised to revolutionize public safety workflows. And because the majority of our body camera customers are on a multi-year subscription, we expect the majority of our customer base to automatically upgrade to Axon Body 3 over the next three years as we build upon our unmatched, rapidly growing network of cloud-connected cameras and other devices. The portion of agencies choosing to activate the LTE connectivity built into every Axon Body 3 camera is exceeding our expectations and we continue to drive that forward in support of our future vision, where cameras use real-time signals and AI to automate transcription and automatically feed information into Axon Records., Axon Records also achieved a critical milestone in September when the Fresno Police Department went live with a full agency-wide Records Management System (RMS) deployment using our cloud subscription service. Cincinnati Police Department has also started using Axon Records for several critical workloads, including use-of-force reporting, and will continue to deploy additional modules throughout 2020 and beyond as part of an agency-wide RMS upgrade to our service. Fresno and Cincinnati PDs are positive reference customers for Axon as we sign new customers and enhance Axon Records' capabilities over time. As a reminder, Axon Records intends to disrupt the law enforcement software category known as Records Management Systems, or RMS, which powers the workloads for writing, storing, managing and sharing official police incident reports. Axon's strategic advantages in this category include our growing network of cloud-connected sensors and our industry-leading cloud SaaS platform, Axon Evidence (Evidence.com), which today is one of the world's largest repositories of data of any type. Cincinnati PD Police Chief Eliot Isaac said, ""We are seeing exceptional benefits with how body camera footage can be directly embedded in our use-of-force, officer accident, citizen complaint and other internal reports."", We are continuing to make progress against our TASER 7 gross margin road map. We are finalizing our new cartridge design that will significantly reduce our bill of materials on the TASER 7 cartridge and we are already seeing cost improvements., And finally, we are especially proud of our corporate social responsibility and environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG)efforts regarding Axon Fleet 3, our next-generation in-car video system, and automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology, which is still under development. ALPR is an important tool for keeping communities safe, as it can help apprehend criminals, find missing children, and recover stolen vehicles — but the existing state of the industry lacks privacy safeguards and thought leadership regarding data retention and data ownership. Axon is leveraging the power of AI to significantly reduce the cost of ALPR systems, making it affordable for every patrol. We are simultaneously addressing industry shortcomings to improve data security, transparency and privacy, and creating an ethical framework to help prevent misuse. Taking a thoughtful approach to issues around AI use in policing, and incorporating guidelines created by Axon's AI and Policing Technology Ethics Board, creates greater long-term value for all our stakeholders: our communities, our customers, and shareholders., People, Among the most important elements of Axon's success is our people and culture. We have more than 1,500 dedicated employees, a deep management bench and a best-in-class Board of Directors who all bring passion to the business every day. In recent months we have further strengthened our team with additions to both management and the Board., In August, Caitlin Kalinowski joined Axon's Board of Directors, expanding the total number of independent directors to seven. Caitlin is the Head of VR Hardware for the Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality division at Facebook and a recognized leader in virtual reality and product design. She is responsible for the product design and engineering of Oculus's award-winning VR devices, has led technical teams at Apple for the Mac Pro and MacBook Air, and was part of the original Unibody MacBook Pro team. She is already bringing her considerable hardware expertise to discussions with our product teams, and providing input on our VR-based officer training platform. We are thrilled to have her as a member of our Board., In September, Jeff Kunins was appointed Chief Product Officer and Executive Vice President of Software, and is responsible for running our global software hub in Seattle. Jeff was most recently with Amazon, where he was Vice President of Alexa Entertainment and led Alexa's global experience, developer platform, and strategic partnerships for music, video, and podcasts across over 100 million Alexa-enabled devices. He has also served in diverse roles including VP of Kindle's global reading experience at Amazon, General Manager of Product and Design at Skype and General Manager of Windows Live Messenger at Microsoft. Jeff is leading Axon's effort to bring to public safety the product experience that consumers have come to expect, and to do so in a way that creates long-term value for our customers, the communities they protect, and Axon. We are thrilled to have him join our executive team., Adjacent Markets, In Q3, the US Forest Service became the first federal agency to outfit all of its officers with TASER devices and body cameras, backed by Axon Evidence. This win was a direct result of Axon's decision a few years ago to make an investment to obtain FedRAMP certification, which would allow federal government customers to store data in our cloud. Since achieving certification in April, we began making more of a concerted effort to capture the federal law enforcement market, which employs more than 120,000 full-time civilian law enforcement officers across dozens of agencies, the largest of which are the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice., In October, Canada's York Regional Police, a major Canadian agency, joined the Axon network with the adoption of the Axon Fleet 2 in-car video system. The agency also purchased 6x more software licenses than camera hardware licenses, showcasing that customers see value in our standalone cloud services. The York Regional Police represent our second international Axon Fleet customer, after a UK agency adopted Axon Fleet in June., Lastly, we are beginning to see positive momentum in the prisons and corrections market, with trials of Axon's body camera and TASER devices leading to significant reductions in staff assaults, use-of-force incidents, and excessive force complaints. The corrections market is adjacent to law enforcement and one that we believe Axon can capture with minimal additional R&D investment. In the US, there are about 430,000 correctional officers and about 92,000 probation and parole officers, and we estimate that TASER device penetration among these officers is minimal, while body camera penetration is nearly zero., We have tended to be conservative in sizing and discussing our $8.4 billion total addressable market, which excludes opportunities in US federal law enforcement, international Axon Fleet, and prisons and corrections. These early proof points suggest that our annual total addressable market is likely much larger., Summary of Q3 2019 Results, Financial commentary by segment, TASER, Three Months Ended, Change, September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, September 30, 2018, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Net sales, $, 71,743, $, 60,572, $, 63,666, 18.4, %, 12.7, %, Gross margin, 63.1, %, 59.9, %, 69.8, %, 320bp, -670bp, , Software and Sensors, Three Months Ended, Change, September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, September 30, 2018, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Axon Cloud net sales, $, 34,021, $, 31,822, $, 23,913, 6.9, %, 42.3, %, Axon Cloud gross margin, 75.8, %, 73.0, %, 73.9, %, 280bp, 190bp, Sensors and Other net sales, $, 25,073, $, 19,968, $, 17,257, 25.6, %, 45.3, %, Sensors and Other gross margin, 36.4, %, 30.1, %, 20.6, %, 630bp, 1580bp, , Forward-Looking Performance Indicators:, September 30, 2019, June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018, ($ in thousands), Annual recurring revenue (1), $, 141,540, $, 129,452, $, 122,276, $, 108,496, $, 101,618, Cumulative Axon software seats booked, 428,600, 397,800, 371,100, 347,200, 325,200, Percentage of TASER devices sold on a recurring payment plan, 55, %, 60, %, 42, %, 35, %, 33, %, Software and Sensors bookings, $, 128,208, $, 142,004, $, 76,391, $, 109,779, $, 92,895, Total company future contracted revenue, $, 1,130,000, $, 1,050,000, $, 930,000, $, 900,000, $, 820,000, (1) Monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue annualized., , Outlook, Axon Body 3's successful manufacturing ramp and on-plan Q3 ship date supports our upwardly revised full year revenue guidance., Axon is developing products that serve law enforcement and public safety professionals, who are present in some of the most significant moments in people's lives. This means that ultimately our products serve the communities and people whom our customers protect. We take our public mission seriously and believe our business is well-positioned to continue serving our customers and communities while creating long-term value for our shareholders., Signed,, Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and Webcast, We will host our Q3 2019 earnings conference call on November 7 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com., Statistical Definitions, Software and Sensors bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software and Sensors hardware, software and Axon Evidence. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, inclusive of renewals, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Oct. 23, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today announced that it is launching the industry's first AI-powered system built from the ground up using an ethical design and privacy-centric framework. Axon will integrate Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) technology into its next generation in-car video system, Axon Fleet 3, incorporating guidelines created by Axon's AI and Policing Technology Ethics Board. The company is announcing its AI-based ALPR capability 12 months ahead of initial deployments as part of a collaborative effort to define best practices and a model framework for implementation through conversations with leading public safety and civil liberties groups and the Ethics Board., , Axon and its Ethics Board will work with public safety thought leaders and diverse community leaders to develop a model framework for law enforcement agencies to responsibly and ethically deploy this technology consistent with the Ethics Board's guidance, which was set forth in their report published today., ""ALPR is an important tool for keeping communities safe as it can help apprehend criminals, find missing children, and recover stolen vehicles,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""We do, however, recognize that there are legitimate concerns about privacy protections, constitutionality of search and data security issues that need to be addressed. We embrace that we have an ethical obligation to develop this technology thoughtfully and bring new privacy safeguards to the industry. While building ALPR, we'll be addressing items such as data retention and data ownership, creating an ethical framework to help prevent misuse of the technology."", Axon is leveraging the power of AI to significantly reduce the cost of ALPR systems, making it affordable for every patrol. Axon is simultaneously addressing industry short-comings to improve data security, transparency and privacy as declining costs enable more widespread use of the technology. Axon plans to work collaboratively with communities to better understand and implement controls such as maximum retention periods and transparency tools., One recommendation in the Ethics Board's report calls for agency ownership and control over the captured license plate data, declaring that data should not be sold for commercial purposes. For years, Axon has protected digital evidence by maintaining a secure cloud-based system that allows agencies to control data, ensuring use only for public safety purposes. Consistent with the Ethics Board's recommendations, Axon will maintain that same high level of security and privacy standards with ALPR data., ""We have not, and will not ever sell public safety data. We believe the data is owned by public safety agencies and the communities they serve, and should not be resold to private entities whose interests may not be aligned with the public good,"" concluded Smith., ""The unregulated use of ALPRs has exposed millions of people subject to surveillance by law enforcement, and the danger to our basic civil rights is only increasing as the technology is becoming more common,"" says Ethics Board member Barry Friedman, founder of the Policing Project at the New York University School of Law and the Jacob D. Fuchsberg Professor of Law at New York University. ""If government is going to continue to abdicate its responsibility to regulate this technology appropriately, and we hope it doesn't, it is incumbent on companies like Axon to ensure that ALPRs serve the communities who are subject to ALPR usage. This includes guardrails to ensure their use does not compromise civil liberties or worsen existing racial and socioeconomic disparities in the criminal justice system."", Axon Fleet 3 will use AI for ALPR to help reduce officer distraction. For example, when searching for stolen vehicles or criminals today, patrol officers manually look up vehicle license plates by typing into their computers. ALPR helps eliminate the need for typing while driving. Today, most agencies deploy ALPR via specialized vehicle units with plate recognition systems that cost tens of thousands of dollars in only a portion of the vehicle fleet. Axon Fleet 3 will integrate ALPR capability in the dashboard camera of every patrol vehicle, allowing agencies to deploy more coverage at a lower cost. Axon Fleet 3 will also enable Axon Aware real-time telemetry and video streaming capabilities and will be upgradeable to 5G to leverage low-latency connectivity for enhanced real-time services and direct video offload to the cloud., Axon will be previewing Axon Fleet 3 at the 126th annual International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) conference, this week in Chicago at Axon's booth number 2211. There, Axon will be demonstrating enhanced 5G real-time services., About Axon, Axon is a global network of devices, apps, training and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Aug. 8, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders., , Dear Shareholders,, In Q2, we delivered excellent progress on our long-term strategic goals while also working through some operational challenges in our TASER segment that resulted in revenue and EBITDA below our expectations., Unexpected short-term pressure on the TASER segment at quarter-end was tied to an inventory shortfall relating to a battery component supplier issue, as well as engineering actions we took to improve the long-term cost structure of our TASER 7 cartridges. We discuss these below in more detail., Key highlights since our last update include:, Product launch updates, As you know, 2019 is a pivotal product launch year for Axon as we ramp TASER 7, begin shipping Axon Body 3, and roll out Axon Records to our launch customers., TASER 7, TASER 7 is an important platform for us that introduces not only a new weapon, but a new cartridge business model, a new training program, and a new cloud-connected software model sold on a subscription-only basis, providing a recurring cash flow stream. Year over year, we have doubled the percentage of TASER device orders tied to a subscription from 30% to 60% of total orders., We continue to see strong customer interest in TASER 7 and expect to begin selling in international markets next year., Axon Body 3, We are thrilled to be pioneering a new category with Axon Body 3, our first body camera with real-time streaming directly over LTE networks. Our current in-market camera, Axon Body 2, established us as the market leader. And the beta version of Axon Body 3 is already the best camera we have ever built., In February, we began Axon Body 3 alpha testing with customers, and in early June, customers began beta testing the device. Axon Body 3 features better video, audio, usability, and durability than Axon Body 2, and is receiving great customer feedback., We have two key objectives in rolling out the next generation of body cameras, which we believe will fundamentally improve policing., To start, we must ensure that our customers' current experience remains as good, or better, even with a more advanced device, not compromising any of the features that made Axon Body 2 the market leader. In addition to designing highly capable imaging and audio modules, we have ensured that the robust Axon Body 3 still has full-shift-ready battery life and retains the simplicity of the user interface., Power management is one of the biggest engineering challenges that we addressed in the device, which has more power-hungry modules than ever before, including a full wireless suite with LTE, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth; our most advanced processor ever; a GPS chip; an upgraded imaging module and multiple microphones. We were able to add these capabilities while retaining up to 12 hours of battery life under predicted usage patterns., Second, we seek to drive new functionality that expands body cameras into true smart sensors that can ultimately make policing more efficient and effective. Axon Body 3 has been in research and development for three years as our engineers have continuously solved challenges in bringing the first product of its kind to market., We have successfully demonstrated improved core user functionality, including improved evidence capture and offloading, and have established a supply chain that achieves manufacturing scalability. Physical integrity engineering is complete, meaning that Axon Body 3 is waterproof and ruggedized for tactical environments. In April, we achieved an important milestone when we successfully demonstrated live-streaming of video., The camera is passing our internal lab and field tests and we are working closely with FirstNet, Built with AT&T, and Verizon, who have been supportive as we bring a new connected device category to market. We expect to begin shipping Axon Body 3 in Q3 2019 after the camera passes certifications from our wireless carrier partners., Axon Records, Axon Records is our groundbreaking new cloud-hosted incident reporting system, which will revolutionize the way law enforcement officers capture and document the details of any incident. Officers can spend up to two-thirds of their shift writing reports, and the records system software is the primary means through which information is captured and disseminated to all the places it needs to go, including the justice system and government agencies. Our leadership in body cameras allows us to make body camera video the heart of the incident record. Over the coming years, we intend to leverage our network of smart sensors together with artificial intelligence to automate the entire reporting process., Axon Records has passed acceptance testing at two major city police departments, both of which are in the process of end user training and operational deployment. We have received positive user feedback, with one early user rating Axon Records as ""seven stars on a scale of one to five.""

This means that ultimately our products serve the communities and people whom police protect. We take our public mission seriously and believe the business is well positioned to continue serving our customers and communities, while creating value for our shareholders over the long term., Signed,, Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and Webcast, We will host our Q2 2019 earnings conference call on August 8 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com., Statistical Definitions, Software & Sensors bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software & Sensors hardware, software and Axon Evidence. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, inclusive of renewals, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps, and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Words such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""predict,"" ""potential,"" ""continue,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""future,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words., We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: customer purchase behavior, including adoption of our software as a service delivery model; the impact of product mix on projected gross margins; our ability to manage our supply chain and avoid production delays, shortages, and impacts to expected gross margins; changes in the costs of product components and labor; defects in our products; delayed cash collections and possible credit losses due to our subscription model; exposure to international operational risks; our ability to design, introduce and sell new products or features; our ability to defend against litigation and protect our intellectual property, and the resulting costs of this activity; our exposure to cancellations of government contracts due to appropriation clauses, exercise of a cancellation clause, or non-exercise of contractually optional periods; loss of customer data, a breach of security or an extended outage, including our reliance on third party cloud-based storage providers; negative media publicity regarding our products; changes in government regulations in the U.S. and in foreign markets, especially related to the classification of our product by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and to evolving regulations surrounding privacy and data protection; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and counter-party risks relating to cash balances held in excess of FDIC insurance limits. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K lists various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These factors are intended as cautionary statements for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Readers can find them under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and investors should refer to them. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties., Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC., Please visit https://investor.axon.com, https://www.axon.com/press, www.twitter.com/axon_us and https://www.facebook.com/Axon.ProtectLife/ where Axon discloses information about the company, its financial information, and its business., For investor relations information please contact Andrea James via email at IR@axon.com., CONTACT:

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., July 25, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today announced the first successful deployment of its new charitable program Axon Aid, which aims to assist cities following large-scale disasters at no cost to citizens. Axon Aid consists of a team of trained Axon volunteers*, equipped with drone technology and Axon Fleet 2 vehicles, who deploy before a natural disaster hits. The first pilot program for Axon Aid launched last week with Baton Rouge Police Department (BRPD) before Hurricane Barry hit. Axon Aid runs from June through November, which is hurricane season in the U.S. To learn more, reach out to aid@axon.com., , Following a natural disaster such as flooding, hurricanes and earthquakes, it can be difficult for a city to gain visibility into exactly where the damage has occurred and what fixes are needed to get infrastructure back up and running. The drone technology offered through the Axon Aid program assists officials in quickly gathering situational awareness through Axon's digital evidence management system, Axon Evidence. Search and rescue efforts, which are often done manually on foot, also benefit. With drone technology, the aerial livestream can help identify victims in need of help and guide first responders to bring aid more quickly., The Axon Aid deployment process activates when a natural disaster is forecasted. The Axon Aid team, which is completely self-sufficient with food, water, electricity, and sleeping arrangements, immediately deploys to the affected area's emergency command center., ""Baton Rouge Police and the entire Baton Rouge community are thankful to have Axon's assistance during Barry's Tropical Storm,"" says Baton Rouge Police Department Chief Murphy Paul. ""Over 900 photos that were provided to us by drone imagery before, during and after the storm were very beneficial in helping us track potential problem areas within the parish. We hope to have Axon Aid continued support during emergency situations."", ""We are proud to offer this charitable program and stand hand-in-hand with partner agencies during their most chaotic times,"" says Axon CEO and founder Rick Smith. ""At Axon, we have the tools to help - and we want to be able to offer those tools when they can be most impactful."", *The Axon Aid volunteers consist of Axon employees across several departments who choose to deploy when an agency calls on Axon Aid for assistance.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 22, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, today announced a partnership with the Chicago Police Department to pilot Axon's virtual reality (VR) empathy-based training. Chicago PD, a Major Cities Chiefs Association member, is the first agency to incorporate Axon's immersive experience into its current crisis intervention training curriculum. Chicago PD is also the first agency to debut Axon's new autism empathy training VR scenario., , Axon's VR training is offered through Axon Academy, a network of online and in-person training for law enforcement. The VR training program is designed to better equip officers with the tools to de-escalate situations involving people suffering from mental health issues, crises or psychotic episodes. The autism empathy scenario is the second VR empathy training offered to customers following a schizophrenia empathy scenario which launched in October 2018. Axon announced its empathy-based training following a survey of 500 US law enforcement professionals, which found that 80% of officers believe there is a need for improved agency tools and resources to effectively de-escalate dangerous situations., ""It's humbling to work with the second largest police department in the country to pilot this VR training program,"" says Laura Brown, Axon's Sr. Director of Training. ""There's no one-size-fits-all strategy for responding to calls for service in the field. The more police officers understand what people are experiencing during a crisis, the more they can adapt their response to effectively de-escalate the situation and protect lives."", The VR technology provides officers with an immersive training where trainees can put themselves in the shoes of both the officer responding to the scene and the person in crisis. For the pilot program, Axon will work closely with the Chicago PD to incorporate the VR training piece into their existing curriculum., ""The goal is to take crisis intervention training out of the classroom, and into a virtual field,"" says Chicago PD Lieutenant Antoinette Ursitti, a Crisis Intervention Team program coordinator. ""We're excited to see how this new partnership with Axon can help our department not only understand civilians in crisis, but equip them to de-escalate situations verbally."", Axon is announcing its partnership with the Chicago PD during Mental Health Awareness Month. In addition to the partnership, Axon is working to assemble a crisis intervention training advisory board to guide the development of empathy-based training scenarios. For both the autism and schizophrenia empathy training, Axon worked with mental health, community and policing experts to ensure an accurate portrayal of a service call involving someone suffering from a mental health crisis., The VR training is available now to US customers who purchase Axon's Officer Safety Plan 7+. They will receive an Oculus Go training headset loaded with both the autism and schizophrenia empathy training., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 21, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Rick Smith, CEO and founder of Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today released his first book The End of Killing, a thought-provoking look at how innovation can eliminate the use of lethal force around the world., , Rick founded TASER International in 1993. Called to action by the shooting death of two high school friends, Rick introduced a less lethal option for law enforcement to carry on their tool belts with the TASER conducted energy weapon (CEW). Today, Rick is continuing his vision to protect life with the release of The End of Killing. This year alone, more than 130 people have been killed in mass shootings, according to one estimate. Meanwhile, the use of lethal force in policing continues to cause rifts between law enforcement and the communities they protect. In The End of Killing, Rick shows us why it doesn't have to be this way, and how technology can become a tool to break the cycle., ""Killing is a technology problem, but with the right technology solutions, humanity can outgrow it,"" Rick says. ""We kill because, today, it is the most reliable way to stop a threat. But we can imagine better solutions—and we just need to invent them."", The End of Killing is available now for purchase on Amazon. A companion graphic novel written by Rick and illustrated by Mark Reihill is available to view here., The End of Killing questions conventional wisdom about how we can solve one of humanity's most daunting problems. Rick challenges some of the biggest names in tech to do more to address the issue, outlines how governments can confront mass shootings, and demonstrates how technology is creating more effective tools for police, homeland security officials and the military. In the book, Rick does not shy away from controversy, and he weighs solutions for how judicious surveillance can protect both lives and privacy., ""Rick Smith is known as the 'Steve Jobs of policing technology' - and this book reflects his well-deserved reputation,"" says former Seattle Police Chief Kathy O'Toole. ""Smith envisions a world free of gun violence. This is a must-read for those who share his bold vision to enhance safety in our communities."", Rick will be hosting his first book reading for The End of Killing before Congress in Washington, DC on May 21st.

It is also the year that we ramp production and sales of the TASER 7, which represents a complete product redesign, the result of seven years of research and development, and connects for the first time to our secure cloud via a dock, just like our body cameras., We have substantial progress to report on our execution against these initiatives., Axon Body 3 remains on track to begin shipping in Q3 2019. In April, we achieved a significant milestone — we successfully demonstrated live-streaming on both of our carrier partners, FirstNet, built with AT&T, and Verizon, and began the carrier certification process., Axon Records is expected to go live with our launch customer, a major city(1) police department, later this year. We have successfully demonstrated that officers can write and review a variety of reports in our system, allowing us to finalize our statement of work with the agency. We are also starting a software pilot with a second major police department. Axon's entry into the records management software market will be groundbreaking because our leadership in body cameras allows us to make body camera video the heart of the incident record., Finally, we have made steady improvements in our TASER 7 production yields. Q1 2019 TASER segment gross margins do not reflect the yield improvements because of our strategic decision to offer pro-rated trade-in credits based on the remaining useful life of customers' existing devices. We have been pleasantly surprised to see the level of interest in TASER 7 from customers with legacy weapons that are still relatively new. Migrating these customers to the TASER 7 program sooner allows us to capture a higher customer lifetime value, though it does cause ASP compression in the short term., Total company gross margin is expected to expand throughout 2019 as we continue to improve TASER 7 yields and realize cost improvements on TASER 7 cartridge parts. Gross margin is also expected to benefit from natural trends in our business, including our growing software revenue mix, the amortization of TASER 7 live cartridge revenue, and the phasing out of TASER trade-in credits. We have conviction that TASER 7 is a game changer for law enforcement, and as we look ahead, we believe the gross profit profile on this program will be significant over the next several years., Customer demand for our products and software continues to be robust. Last week, we hosted our fourth annual Accelerate conference, which has grown from 200 attendees to more than 1,800, becoming the leading technology conference for public safety professionals. The strength of our customer relationships and their excitement about new technologies under development was palpable., We are building a pipeline of dozens of multi-million dollar, multi-year contracts comprised of our highest value bundles. Importantly, we are seeing increased demand for our highest value TASER 7 contract bundle, which includes user training and unlimited duty cartridges. (See image: Revenue and gross margin by bundle.), April was an important month for software development that supports our highest value bundles. Two product launches in particular should drive demand for OSP 7+ packages, and will allow us to recognize high margin software revenue., First, we launched Axon Performance, analytical software that solves the need to ensure that body camera usage consistently complies with agency policy. Today, supervising officers undergo the arduous task of manually reviewing service call logs and comparing them to camera recording logs. Axon Performance automates this process in real time and reports metrics such as officers' body-worn camera activation rates and video categorization rates. Axon Performance also allows supervising officers to review random videos and provide documented feedback to ensure a robust oversight of their program., Another product launch, Redaction Assistant, is our first advanced AI-powered tool. Solving the redaction challenges of body camera video is important for helping agencies comply with public disclosure laws while also respecting individuals' right to privacy. Compared with manual redaction, Redaction Assistant helps public information officers redact video in less than half the time - using AI assistance in blurring faces, license plates and screens - allowing footage to be shared with the public more quickly and with dramatically lower costs due to task automation., Also in April, Axon achieved FedRAMP JAB authorization, clearing the way for federal government customers to use Axon Evidence (Evidence.com). Clearing this hurdle involved three years of site reliability engineering, architecture design and information security efforts. Axon Evidence is the first cloud-based digital evidence management system to achieve federal authorization, supporting our efforts to capture this expansive opportunity., (1) The Major Cities Chiefs Association includes 69 of the largest urban areas in the United States and the 10 largest cities in Canada., Summary of Q1 2019 Results, Financial commentary by segment, TASER, Three Months Ended, Change, March 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, March 31, 2018, QoQ, YoY, TASER, Net sales, $, 65,391, $, 65,301, $, 63,524, 0.1, %, 2.9, %, Gross margin, 64.4, %, 65.0, %, 67.7, %, -60bp, -330bp, , Software & Sensors, Three Months Ended, Change, March 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, March 31, 2018, QoQ, YoY, Software and Sensors, Axon Cloud net sales, $, 27,631, $, 25,774, $, 20,241, 7.2, %, 36.5, %, Axon Cloud gross margin, 73.6, %, 74.5, %, 78.7, %, -90bp, -510bp, Sensors and Other net sales, $, 22,788, $, 23,716, $, 17,450, (3.9), %, 30.6, %, Sensors and Other gross margin, 28.4, %, 15.7, %, 31.9, %, 1,270bp, -350bp, , Performance Figures, March 31, 2019, December 31,2018, September 30,2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018, Annual recurring revenue (1), $, 122,276, $, 108,496, $, 101,618, $, 92,711, $, 83,310, Cumulative Axon software seats booked, 371,100, 347,200, 325,200, 305,200, 226,900, Software and Sensors bookings, $, 76,391, $, 109,779, $, 92,895, $, 88,860, $, 97,528, Total company future contracted revenue, $, 930,000, $, 900,000, $, 820,000, $, 750,000, $, 650,000, (1) Monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue annualized., , , , , , Outlook
    For full year 2019, we are providing the following guidance:, We are pleased with our year-to-date execution and look forward to updating you throughout the year., Signed,, Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and Webcast, We will host our Q1 2019 earnings conference call on May 9 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com., Statistical Definitions, Software & Sensors bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software & Sensors hardware, software and Axon Evidence. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps, and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Words such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""predict,"" ""potential,"" ""continue,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""future,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words., We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: customer purchase behavior, including adoption of our software as a service delivery model; delayed cash collections and possible credit losses due to our subscription model; exposure to international operational risks; changes in the costs of product components and labor; defects in our products; the impact of product mix on projected gross margins; our ability to manage our supply chain and avoid production delays, shortages, and impacts to expected gross margins; our ability to design, introduce and sell new products or features; our ability to defend against litigation and protect our intellectual property, and the resulting costs of this activity; our exposure to cancellations of government contracts due to appropriation clauses, exercise of a cancellation clause, or non-exercise of contractually optional periods; loss of customer data, a breach of security or an extended outage, including our reliance on third party cloud-based storage providers; negative media publicity regarding our products; changes in government regulations in the U.S. and in foreign markets, especially related to the classification of our product by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and to evolving regulations surrounding privacy and data protection; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and counter-party risks relating to cash balances held in excess of FDIC insurance limits. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K lists various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These factors are intended as cautionary statements for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Readers can find them under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in the Report on Form 10-K and in the Report on Form 10-Q, and investors should refer to them. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties., Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 1, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today announced that more than 1,800 public safety professionals attended the Axon Accelerate conference to hear from more than 70 speakers and experience all the products offered through the Axon network. Throughout the conference, Axon unveiled several new products and features - many of which are available on the Officer Safety Plan (OSP) 7+. The plan allows users to leverage the power of the Axon network by bundling next-generation devices like the TASER 7 and Axon Body 3 with the innovative records management system, Axon Records. For full details of the announcements made during Axon Accelerate 2019, see below., , Redaction Assistant, Axon announced the launch of Redaction Assistant, the first advanced artificial intelligence (AI) powered tool to be offered to law enforcement agencies and prosecutors through the Axon network. Redaction Assistant is a productivity tool built to increase efficiency for agencies who currently spend up to eight hours manually redacting each hour of body camera video footage. Currently, when redacting video footage, users are manually drawing boxes around objects frame-by-frame. With Redaction Assistant, the AI detects a license plate, face or screen and automatically draws a box around it so the user can then confirm whether it is an object that needs to be redacted. The technology is similar to what is found in almost all cell phone cameras where objects of interest, such as faces, are detected to improve the lighting conditions of the captured image. Redaction Assistant is available now to agencies in the US, UK and Canada as a software add-on and is included automatically for US agencies on Axon's Officer Safety Plan (OSP) 7+. To learn more about Redaction Assistant, visit: https://www.axon.com/assistant., Axon Performance, Axon also announced the launch of Axon Performance, a data analytics platform that helps to streamline the policy review process for law enforcement agencies. Axon Performance allows supervisors to more efficiently review video footage, perform agency-wide officer performance evaluations, identify training needs and save officers time so they can spend more time in their communities. Today, supervising officers undergo the arduous task of manually sorting through and reviewing the camera footage captured by officer's body cameras. Axon Performance helps reduce this time-consuming task by tracking and reporting metrics such as whether an officer's body-worn camera has been activated or if the videos have been correctly categorized. It is available to purchase today as a software add-on for existing customers and is included for agencies purchasing the Officer Safety Plan (OSP) 7+. To learn more about Axon Performance, visit: https://www.axon.com/performance., Axon Air, Updates to the Axon Air program were also showcased at Axon Accelerate. Axon Air, the unmanned aircraft program for public safety, can now ingest data captured on drone devices directly into the digital evidence management system, Axon Evidence (Evidence.com). The software offloads the captured footage and associated metadata from the drone into Axon Evidence via the Axon Air app. The video is treated with the same rigorous data management system and security protocols that law enforcement agencies rely on to preserve and protect data from body cameras and in-car video systems. Axon Air is available as an add-on license to customers on the Pro or Basic user licenses. To learn more about Axon Air visit: https://www.axon.com/air., Axon Body 3, Axon announced that the first shipments of the next generation body-worn camera, Axon Body 3, will ship to customers in the third quarter of 2019. Featuring an LTE connection and new Axon Aware real-time technology, the camera introduces real-time features like live maps and streaming. Coupled with enhanced low-light performance, clearer audio and reduced motion blur, Axon Body 3 will help agencies capture clearer evidence and improve officer safety with real-time situational awareness. Deployment follows heavy testing - alpha and beta testing will continue over the next two months and inform expanding capabilities over time. To learn more about Axon Body 3 visit: https://www.axon.com/body-3., Axon Aid, A new charitable initiative was also unveiled at Axon Accelerate named Axon Aid, a program which utilizes drone technology to assist in response and recovery efforts during natural disasters. When a disaster strikes, Axon can deploy its team of trained pilots geared with drones and fully outfitted Axon Fleet 2 vehicles to the agency command center. The teams, which are completely self-sufficient, will act as an asset to the agency during their response and recovery efforts. This effort will be executed at no cost to the partner agency. Axon Aid will deploy on June 1, 2019.

Redaction Assistant is available now to agencies in the US, UK and Canada as a software add-on and is included automatically for US agencies on Axon's Officer Safety Plan (OSP) 7+., , ""I'm excited to see our first advanced AI-powered product come to life,"" says Moji Solgi, Axon VP of AI and Machine Learning. ""We've put a huge focus on developing a technology that will both increase efficiency for our public safety customers and at the same time increase transparency for the public."", Redaction Assistant is now included in Axon's Redaction Studio, announced in 2017. It is Axon's first advanced redaction product to be powered by AI. Currently, when redacting video footage, users are manually drawing boxes around objects frame-by-frame. With Redaction Assistant, the AI detects a license plate, face or screen and automatically draws a box around it so the user can then confirm whether it is an object that needs to be redacted. The workflow is streamlined so the video is redacted and ready to share with the public much more quickly., The face detection tool detects that there is a human face in the frame and redacts it - it does not identify the individual to whom the face belongs, neither does it recognize their race, age, gender, etc. The technology is similar to what is found in almost all cell phone cameras where objects of interest, such as faces, are detected to improve the lighting conditions of the captured image., The City of Kent Law Department is one of several agencies that began partnering with Axon in the first quarter of 2019 to trial Redaction Assistant. In the first three weeks of using Redaction Assistant, the department found that their video redaction workload decreased by 81%., ""I no longer believe I need an additional attorney to help with the workload increase as I can hire and train a support staff person to handle the majority of work associated with the footage,"" says Chief Prosecutor for the City of Kent, Tami A. Perdue. ""This tool has completely changed my staffing recommendations, and consequently, will save our City a significant amount of money. I am very impressed with the product."", The Axon AI team engaged with the AI & Policing Technology Ethics Board on Redaction Assistant and will continue to collaborate with them on future development of AI technologies. The mission of this independent board is to provide expert guidance to Axon on the development of its AI products and services, paying particular attention to its impact on communities., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

It is available to purchase today as a software add-on for existing customers and is included for agencies purchasing the Officer Safety Plan (OSP) 7+., , ""Launching Axon Performance is a major achievement — and we are confident that this data analytics software will enhance effective policing,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""We are proud of the work that agencies have done in implementing body-worn cameras, bringing more transparency to their communities. Axon Performance gives these agencies the power to harness greater insights from all the footage they have collected."", Designed in close consultation with agencies, Axon Performance solves a real need. Today, supervising officers undergo the arduous task of manually sorting through and reviewing the camera footage captured by officer's body cameras. Axon Performance helps reduce this time-consuming task by tracking and reporting metrics such as whether an officer's body-worn camera has been activated or if the videos have been correctly categorized. Supervising officers are able to save time by completing evaluations while in the field via their Mobile Data Terminal (MDT) rather than driving back to the station to complete paperwork. Other benefits of Axon Performance include:, Law enforcement agencies around the country varying in size and phase of adoption partnered with Axon starting in the fourth quarter of 2018 to trial Axon Performance. Over the four-month Early Access Program, the partner agencies saw a combined six percent increase in camera activations when officers interacted with the public. That's 1,100 more interactions with the public captured on body-worn camera footage, which would have otherwise resulted in no video record of the service call., Axon Performance is available now to all US agencies and will be available to international customers in the first half of 2020., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer. With a mission of protecting life, our technologies give customers the confidence, focus and time they need to keep their communities safe.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 26, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in public safety technology, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders. Financial performance included the following record results:, , , Dear shareholders,, We delivered a record 2018, executing across multiple fronts. Our strong top-line performance reflects the health of our growing software network, Axon's increasing international presence and our ability to expand into new product categories such as Axon Fleet in-car video. Our bottom line grew twice as fast, reflecting the rigor and cost-discipline we have established over the last 18 months., We strengthened our balance sheet through strong operating cash generation and the successful completion of a follow-on offering, supporting our goal to continue driving subscription contracts and recurring cash flow growth. Additionally, we acquired body camera provider Vievu in a $7 million upfront cash and stock transaction(1), which added five major city customers and accelerated the largest police department in the US onto the Axon network., We concluded the year by launching TASER 7, the most significant redesign of the TASER device since 2003, and unveiling our first LTE-connected body camera, Axon Body 3., Heading into 2019, Axon continues to build a foundation to support our next decade of growth and profitability. Our product and engineering teams are heavily focused on four major or ""Alpha"" strategic growth areas, with dedicated product leadership. These growth drivers are 1) TASER, 2) Sensors (including the related software), 3) Records (our new records management software), and 4) Dispatch (computer-aided dispatch software)., We've also deployed small, nimble product teams tasked with going after select break-out market opportunities. These scrappy ""Delta"" teams include Axon Air, which leverages our drone reseller partnership with DJI, our TASER consumer team, which is focused on the self-defense market, and three additional, yet-to-be-announced initiatives., Additionally, for the first time, we've assigned dedicated sales personnel to markets adjacent to law enforcement, including fire departments and emergency medical services, federal government and military, corrections, private security, and commercial enterprise. Early successes include the Charlotte Fire Department, which is the first major city fire department to deploy Axon body cameras backed by our software network, and Cypress Creek Emergency Medical Services, which is the first EMS provider in the U.S. to deploy our camera solution to paramedics. There, body camera footage from an ambulance has already assisted emergency room doctors in saving lives., (1)The purchase price of Vievu consisted of $4.6 million in cash and $2.4 million in common stock issued to Safariland at closing. Deal terms also included consideration of up to 141,226 shares of common stock, contingent upon achieving certain milestones over two years, as well as minimum holster purchase commitments., These market adjacencies offer the potential to grow our total addressable market and drive incremental opportunity beyond our four strategic areas of investment., In 2019, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new cloud-connected products, including TASER 7 and Axon Fleet 2, both of which are currently shipping, and Axon Body 3, which we expect to begin shipping in the second half. Customer reception to TASER 7 has been exceedingly positive. We've discussed these new products in detail in our previous quarterly letter. Importantly, we expect to continue driving leverage through administrative cost controls, as well as improvements in new customer contract pricing. At the same time, we will continue to invest in R&D to deliver innovation and fuel long-term growth., Summary of Q4 2018 Results (2), (2)Amounts for Q4 2017 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of Topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under ASC 605. Revenue for Q4 2018 would have been $114.2 million under ASC 605., (3) After Axon acquired Vievu in May 2018, we began migrating several Vievu customers over to the Axon network. One large domestic customer accelerated its move to the Axon network in Q4 2018, resulting in excess inventory write downs and charges for excess purchase commitments in the period., (4) Our estimate of EBITDA losses related to Vievu includes those direct costs incurred by the Vievu legal entity plus legacy Vievu employee costs. It does not include any other costs of supporting the acquired Vievu customers., Financial commentary by segment, TASER:, Three Months Ended, Change, December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 (1), QoQ, YoY, TASER, Net sales, $, 65,301, $, 63,666, $, 64,409, 2.6, %, 1.4, %, Gross margin, 65.0, %, 69.8, %, 70.9, %, -480bp, -590bp, (1) Amounts for the three months ended December 31, 2017 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of Topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under ASC 605., , , , Software & Sensors:, Three Months Ended, Change, December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 (1), QoQ, YoY, Software and Sensors, Axon Cloud net sales, $, 25,774, $, 23,913, $, 17,143, 7.8, %, 50.3, %, Axon Cloud gross margin, 74.5, %, 73.9, %, 68.2, %, 60bp, 630bp, Sensors and Other net sales, $, 23,716, $, 17,257, $, 13,099, 37.4, %, 81.1, %, Sensors and Other gross margin, 15.7, %, 20.6, %, 43.0, %, -490bp, -2,730bp, (1) Amounts for the three months ended December 31, 2017 have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method of adoption of Topic 606, and are presented consistent with the prior period amounts reported under ASC 605., , , December 31, 2018, September 30, 2018, June 30, 2018, March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, Software and Sensors Bookings, $, 109,779, $, 92,895, $, 88,860, $, 97,528, $, 71,154, Software and Sensors Annual Recurring Revenue (1), $, 108,496, $, 101,618, $, 92,711, $, 83,310, $, 69,960, Cumulative Axon Cloud seats booked, 347,200, 325,200, 305,200, 226,900, 201,500, (1) Monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue annualized., , Outlook:, For full year 2019, we expect to achieve:, We look forward to updating you throughout the year as we ship new products, gain a foothold and delight our early customers in Axon Records, and drive leverage on the bottom line., Signed,, Rick Smith, CEO Luke Larson, President Jawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and Webcast, We will host our Q4 2018 earnings conference call on February 26 at 2 p.m. PT / 3 p.m. AZT / 5 p.m. ET., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com., Statistical Definitions, Software & Sensors bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software & Sensors hardware, software and Axon Evidence. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps, and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 12, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today announced shareholders approved the company's eXponential Stock Performance Plan (XSPP). At a special meeting for shareholders held on February 12, 2019, 76% of voting shares were in favor of the unique compensation plan that allows employees to align their pay directly with value creation for shareholders., , The most innovative companies in the US confront high turnover and fierce competition for talent. The XSPP was designed to tackle well-known technology industry challenges around recruiting and retention while also incorporating shareholder-friendly features such as guardrails around dilution and mandatory stock holding periods after vesting., ""Axon is proud to be a thought leader in driving strong alignment between senior management, employees and shareholders,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""The XSPP has energized our workforce — providing employees the chance to realize the outsized returns of a startup, but only if we also deliver outsized value to shareholders."", In December 2018, Axon allocated awards of 60 performance-vesting stock units under the XSPP to every U.S. employee. In addition, more than 300 employees elected to allocate a portion of their on-target earnings into the plan over the next nine years, resulting in an allocation of approximately $75 million of guaranteed compensation into at-risk performance-based restricted stock units., ""I believe that the overwhelming shareholder support for the XSPP will be an inspiration to other companies,"" says Joseph L. Johnson III, Partner at Goodwin Procter, the global 50 law firm that served as Axon's external counsel in developing the XSPP. ""In the tech space in particular, I think we'll start to see a trend of companies engaging with their shareholders about how to best motivate employees and think about better aligning employee pay with performance and value creation."", About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

The XSPP is a unique compensation plan that gives employees a new opportunity to align their pay directly with value creation for shareholders., , All U.S. employees have received awards of 60 performance-vesting stock units under the plan, and more than 300 employees elected to allocate a portion of their on-target earnings (OTE) into the plan over the next nine years. In total, employees chose to allocate approximately $75 million of guaranteed compensation over the next nine years into at-risk performance-based restricted stock units., The XSPP vesting schedule uses the same milestones as those set for the CEO Performance Award granted in February 2018 and approved by Axon shareholders in May, which ties significant increases in revenue and adjusted EBITDA to $1 billion increments in market cap., ""I'm thrilled at this unparalleled level of commitment and alignment. I believe it will be a game changer, adding rocket fuel to our mission to protect life,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""I would especially like to thank our larger shareholders for their thoughtful input into the plan design, yielding improvements such as the 3% annual dilution guardrail, which we included to ensure the incentives were aligned to drive outsize growth while keeping dilution at or below industry norms — even including the effects of the XSPP itself."", ""One of the biggest challenges in tech is attracting and retaining top talent,"" says Hadi Partovi, chairman of the compensation committee for Axon's board of directors, and also CEO and founder of Code.org.

Additionally, certain employees have elected to allocate a portion of their future on-target earnings to be granted in the form of additional XSUs. The number of XSUs an employee receives is based on a 3x risk multiplier, which is then further multiplied by the nine year length of the program. The total number of XSUs received by an employee is then divided evenly into 12 tranches that vest at the same market and performance criteria as the 2018 CEO Performance Award. If Axon hits its targets outlined in the plan, employees will receive rewards that are aligned with exceptional returns for shareholders.

"MISSISSAUGA, ON, Nov. 20, 2020 /CNW/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, and its subsidiary Axon Public Safety Canada, Inc., today announced that the Peel Regional Police (PRP) is deploying 1,200 Axon Body 3 cameras along with an additional 515 licenses (1,715 total) to its digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence. This order was received in the third quarter of 2020 and will ship in multiple phases over Q4 2020, Q1 and Q2 2021., The Axon Body 3 is Axon's first Long-Term-Evolution-connected camera. It offers live streaming capabilities for authorized users to view an incident that is happening in the field, in real-time. This would allow PRP the ability to provide remote support to their officers and community in cases where it may be unsafe for partners, such as mental health professionals, to attend in person., PRP will also be one of the first police services in Canada to utilize Axon Performance, allowing them to streamline the review process to ensure that officers wearing cameras are operating within agency guidelines and policies to maximize public trust in their body worn camera program., ""We have embarked on a digital innovation and technology roadmap to not just simply adopt contemporary technology platforms, but to leverage them beyond traditional methods to enhance public safety and increase the effectiveness of our front line,"" says Peel Regional Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah. ""These are the types of initiatives which I and the team have committed to accelerating in order to build resiliency within our community."", Deputy Chief Anthony Odoardi, Officer in Charge of the Innovation and Technology Command, is committed to ensuring that the needs of officers and the community are met through this tech innovation., ""As we continue to modernize our organization, our vision is to utilize available innovation and technology tools to enhance community safety and well-being while demonstrating the professionalism of our frontline members. PRP has taken a leading role in introducing the concept and framework for providing real-time enhanced services, utilizing body-worn camera live-stream technology,"" Deputy Chief Odoardi says. ""These opportunities include utilizing embedded medical professionals in our real-time operations centre to assist frontline members in safely supporting persons in crisis. We also look to provide social supports in real-time that would otherwise not be achieved through traditional response models."", ""Our mission has always been to protect life. By enabling services to streamline review processes and reduce time spent on administrative tasks, we can immediately help first responders and public safety officials reduce their time at the office and spend more time with the community,"" says Axon's Managing Director for Canada, Vishal Dhir. ""We strongly believe Axon Performance can help build community trust and increase public confidence as Peel Regional Police deploy their body camera program."", Peel Regional Police will also be updating all of its interview rooms to the latest version of Axon Interview while leveraging the same cloud-based repository, Axon Evidence, to further achieve a centralized and robust digital evidence management system., With Axon Evidence, PRP can manage and share digital evidence more efficiently, both internally and externally, including with local Crown Attorneys.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 5, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --, , Dear Shareholders,, As 2020 enters the final stretch, Axon is on track to exit the year strong. We are pleased to report a surge in momentum in our business in the third quarter. We drove bookings[1] growth of 62% sequentially and 56% year over year, aided by robust North American demand for body cameras and cloud software, and a rebound in TASER demand driven by the US federal and corrections markets. High-margin annual recurring revenue topped $200 million, doubling in two years' time. And we are on track to exceed our original 2020 financial targets — which is a testament to the mental toughness and dedication of our teams and the market's reception to our products that solve real problems., In February, we told investors that our strategic priorities in 2020 included continuing to execute in our core market, while expanding to new customer segments and accelerating our path-to-market in new product categories. We are pleased to be executing to plan, even amid the economic and logistical challenges presented by the pandemic., The following two areas of strength are the direct result of accelerated investments in the US federal law enforcement channel and the development of real-time command-and-control software for public safety., [1] Bookings represents the total expected revenue contribution of contracts signed in the quarter that have a five-year length or shorter. We further define this metric under ""Statistical Definitions."", U.S. federal customers generate $38 million in quarterly bookings, We are thrilled to report rapid progress in the federal market. As a result of targeted investments in building direct relationships with federal customers, we achieved a record $38 million in bookings from federal customers in the third quarter, up 400% year over year. Our successes include the following new programs and contracts, many of which are firsts for Axon:, We announced Axon Respond, our end-to-end platform to power real-time operations, We introduced Axon Respond to the industry at our August user conference. Although we have talked generally with the investment community about our growing suite of dispatch and communications products, the launch of Respond represented our first formal communication to customers about the availability of ""real-time operations"" — a broader vision for the category. We are now building a book of business for the platform, which comprises a modern cloud-based dispatch system, communications capabilities, real-time situational awareness through GPS-and-LTE-enabled body cameras, in-car cameras and drones, and integrated light bar and weapon deployment signals, giving everyone a real-time map of what is happening. It is accessible from any device, and is built to evolve, unlike legacy on-premises systems., The Respond platform is made up of several products that work together and are integrated with Axon's software suite, which includes digital evidence management and Axon Records. Our teams built this platform after conducting more than 1,000 hours of customer research, which uncovered several consistent problems with legacy 911 dispatching operations: Basic usability falls short of modern software design standards that most consumers take for granted, on-premise legacy systems are inherently less reliable than the modern cloud, and upgrades and performance improvements are complex and infrequent rather than seamless and ongoing. Delayed responses in 911 can be caused by delayed situational awareness — a gap between an event occurring and the system of responders being able to react to the development. Also, officers often have to juggle a rat's nest of tools — cobbled together from consumer applications, dispatching applications, texting and radio., We have a growing number of customers using components of Respond. And many agencies are using it regularly as part of their routine police work. In a recent survey of more than 200 users by TechValidate, 90% said that Respond has had a ""positive"" or ""extremely"" positive impact on officer safety. Respond is also driving situational awareness, efficiency of daily command operations, and improving relationships with communities., In the past month, more than 200 agencies have used Respond for Devices (previously referred to as Axon Aware), which is the GPS-enabled service that pairs with the Axon Body 3 camera. Customers include the Atlanta and Cincinnati police departments and Toronto Police Service. In addition, over the past six months, we have seen a 6x increase in usage of live-streaming with Respond for Devices., In April, Arizona's City of Maricopa Police Department moved over from a competitor and went live on Axon's cloud-based computer aided dispatch (CAD) solution to power their 911 incident response — representing our first Dispatch customer. We are encouraged by the pipeline of additional Dispatch customers, as we aim to be first in the category in the coming years., International expansion continues:, Recent milestones in our international expansion include the Toronto Police Service's deployment of Axon body cameras, the London Metropolitan Police's upgrade to Axon Body 3 cameras, government approval to sell TASER 7 in the UK, and the first major agency in Ukraine purchasing TASER devices., International revenue of $23 million in the quarter represented 15% year-over-year growth and reflected typical third quarter seasonality. Year-to-date international revenue is up 43%., ""Deciding to go with an Axon body camera program was the best decision for Toronto Police Service because the cameras are just part of the bigger picture. The real value is within the digital evidence management solution, which will allow us to manage and share evidence with ease, speed and less costs."" --Toronto Police Service Superintendent Michael Barsky, ""The National Police of Ukraine will start using TASER (devices) for its operations, which is a completely new tool for law enforcement agencies in our country. We have carefully studied the usage of these devices globally and believe that equipping our units with this innovative device will make them more effective in protecting the rule of law and civil order. We look forward to a long-term partnership with Axon and to truly harnessing the power of their network."" --Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Anton Gerashchenko, Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) update, Axon is a mission-driven company whose overarching goal is to protect life. Our vision is a world where bullets are obsolete, where social conflict is dramatically reduced, and where everyone has access to a fair and effective justice system. We continue to strengthen our focus on ESG., We see 100% of our revenues as generated by products and solutions that support the UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly goals 5, 9, 11 and 16. These goals seek to achieve gender equality, build resilient infrastructure and foster innovation, promote safe living conditions in urban areas, reduce violence and death rates, promote the rule of law to ensure everyone equal access to justice, and develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions., Following the death of George Floyd and this summer's social unrest, Axon became one of the first companies to announce an action plan, including a commitment to help public safety agencies in their work to address systemic inequity, racism, and injustice. As part of this commitment, Axon added a new strategic goal to our mission — to center racial equity, diversity, and inclusion., On October 28, we unveiled our first eight product features developed in direct support of this goal, which we built through a company-wide initiative called Sprint for Justice. The features focus on transparency, truth and officer development, and aim to reduce violence and social conflict. Importantly, they increase officer accountability with features such as automatically prioritizing body camera videos selected for random audits based on events such as unholstering a TASER device or spoken keywords from the AI-powered transcription of the audio, a use of force dashboard, virtual reality training to assist in handling high-stakes situations like peer intervention, and replay coaching to revisit body camera footage and promote ongoing learning and development., Summary of Q3 2020 results:, Financial commentary by segment:, TASER, THREE MONTHS ENDED, CHANGE, 30 SEP 2020, 30 JUN 2020, 30 SEP 2019, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Net sales, $, 84,406, $, 70,490, $, 71,743, 19.7, %, 17.7, %, Gross margin, 62.9, %, 61.4, %, 63.1, %, 150, bp, (20), bp, Software & Sensors, THREE MONTHS ENDED, CHANGE, 30 SEP 2020, 30 JUN 2020, 30 SEP 2019, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Axon Cloud net sales, $, 45,462, $, 41,891, $, 34,021, 8.5, %, 33.6, %, Axon Cloud gross margin, 77.1, %, 77.9, %, 75.8, %, (80), bp, 130, bp, Sensors and Other net sales, $, 36,574, $, 28,878, $, 25,073, 26.7, %, 45.9, %, Sensors and Other gross margin, 27.5, %, 42.6, %, 36.4, %, (1,510), bp, (890), bp, Forward-looking performance indicators:, 30 SEP 2020, 30 JUN 2020, 31 MAR 2020, 31 DEC 2019, 30 SEP 2019, ($ in thousands), Annual recurring revenue (1), $, 203,815, $, 183,498, $, 173,919, $, 161,277, $, 141,540, Net revenue retention (2), 120, %, 119, %, 119, %, 121, %, *, Total company future contracted revenue (2), $, 1,510,000, $, 1,340,000, $, 1,274,000, $, 1,230,000, $, 1,130,000, Percentage of TASER devices sold on a recurring payment plan, 75, %, 46, %, 43, %, 58, %, 55, %, _____________________, (1)    Monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue annualized., (2)    Refer to ""Statistical Definitions"" below., *       Not disclosed., Outlook:, The following forward-looking statements reflect Axon's expectations as of November 5, 2020, and are subject to uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic., The impact of COVID-19 remains fluid, although we believe we sell products that meet a critical need. Reductions in economic activity could bring renewed caution from police departments on budgeting. Similar to our communication in our August update, we are not seeing changes in buying activity due to police defunding concerns. We have seen some anecdotal acceleration of body camera buying decisions due to agencies wishing to provide transparency to their communities., Thank you for your engagement and investment in Axon., Signed,, Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and webcast, We will host our Q3 2020 earnings conference call on Thursday, November 5 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The webcast will be available via a link on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com (https://investor.axon.com/), or can be accessed directly via https://axon.zoom.us/j/93010191090., Statistical Definitions, Bookings: We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, inclusive of renewals, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided, so long as they are expected to occur within five years. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods. Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although we have entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipate the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate funds in future year budgets, or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings. Bookings, as presented here, represent total company bookings inclusive of all products, and should not be confused with our historical reported measure of Software & Sensors bookings, which excluded TASER-related bookings. Certain customers sign contracts for time periods longer than five-years, which generates a larger-sized booking — but the expected exercise amounts after the five-year period is not included in bookings, as described here, in order to facilitate comparisons between periods., Net revenue retention: Dollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers. We calculate it as the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of agency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This calculation includes high-margin warranty but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription contingent of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments -- meaning that for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution. For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Total company future contracted revenue: Total company future contracted revenue includes both recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. The remaining performance obligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606 as of September 30, 2020. We expect to recognize between 20% - 25% of this balance over the next twelve months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following five to seven years, subject to risks related to delayed deployments, budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is the global leader in connected public safety technologies.

The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the potential global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; our exposure to cancellations of government contracts due to appropriation clauses, exercise of a cancellation clause, or non-exercise of contractually optional periods; our ability to design, introduce and sell new products or features; our ability to defend against litigation and protect our intellectual property, and the resulting costs of this activity; our ability to manage our supply chain and avoid production delays, shortages, and impacts to expected gross margins; the impact of stock compensation expense, impairment expense, and income tax expense on our financial results; customer purchase behavior, including adoption of our software as a service delivery model; negative media publicity regarding our products; the impact of product mix on projected gross margins; defects in our products; changes in the costs of product components and labor; loss of customer data, a breach of security, or an extended outage, including our reliance on third party cloud-based storage providers; exposure to international operational risks; delayed cash collections and possible credit losses due to our subscription model; changes in government regulations in the U.S. and in foreign markets, especially related to the classification of our products by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and to evolving regulations surrounding privacy and data protection; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and counter-party risks relating to cash balances held in excess of FDIC insurance limits. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q list various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These factors are intended as cautionary statements for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Readers can find them under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and investors should refer to them. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties., Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC., Update on Legal Matters:, Axon v. FTC, Axon continues to both vigorously prosecute its Federal court case against the FTC and defend the FTC's separate administrative action against the company., The FTC's administrative hearing that was scheduled to begin on October 13, 2020 has been put on temporary hold by the Federal court of appeals., As background, Axon's Federal court constitutional challenge against the FTC was dismissed in April, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction, holding that Axon must first bring its claims through the FTC's administrative process. Axon appealed that ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (No. 20-15662), which granted expedited consideration and held oral argument on July 17, 2020. On October 2, 2020, the Ninth Circuit stayed the FTC administrative hearing to preserve the status quo pending its ruling on Axon's appeal on the merits., Copies of Axon's Federal court filings, including its most recent appellate brief, can be found on Axon's FTC Investor Briefing page at https://www.axon.com/ftc., As a reminder, in parallel to these matters Axon is evaluating strategic alternatives to litigation, which Axon might pursue if determined to be in the best interests of shareholders and customers. This could include a divestiture of the Vievu entity and/or related assets. While Axon continues to believe the acquisition of Vievu in 2018 was lawful and a benefit to Vievu's customers, the cost, risk and distraction of protracted litigation merit consideration of settlement if achievable on terms agreeable to the FTC and Axon., For investor relations information please contact Andrea James via email at IR@axon.com., AXON ENTERPRISE, INC., CONSOLIDATED

"SEATTLE, Oct. 28, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Following the death of George Floyd and this summer's social unrest, Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, was one of the first companies to announce its action plan, including a commitment to help public safety agencies in their work to address systemic inequity, racism, and injustice. As part of this commitment, Axon added a new strategic goal to its mission — centering racial equity, diversity, and inclusion. Today, Axon is announcing its first eight product features developed in direct support of this goal, which the company built through a unique company-wide initiative called Sprint for Justice., , Sprint for Justice was driven by Axon employees' passion to do even more in service of Axon's mission to protect life. This initiative required Axon engineers to find a way to meet existing customer commitments and make room to build new features tied to the new goal. As a result, more than 200 engineers from across nearly every team in the company came together to build eight new features from start to finish. This intensive two-week sprint offers Axon's public safety customers even more tools to increase transparency, capture truth and support officer development. Learn more about Sprint for Justice, here., ""Everything we build is already focused on protecting life and using technology as a force for good, but our product teams were particularly inspired by the events of this summer to do more and do it faster,"" says Chief Product Officer and Executive Vice President of Software, Jeff Kunins.

""Not only will it save us time, but by surfacing issues that need attention, it will support our ability to uphold the individual rights and dignity for all people in our community."", As part of Sprint for Justice, as with all product development, Axon leveraged its ethics framework established by the Axon AI and Policing Technology Ethics Board to ensure the new products were developed responsibly. In addition to working with its AI Ethics Board, Axon has committed to listening to community members by launching a forthcoming Community Coalition. With this group, Axon will conduct voice of customer sessions with community members to ensure that products reflect the needs of the public., ""Axon has a responsibility to support racial justice efforts, and we are proud to help build a bridge between communities and police,"" said Axon VP of Community Impact Regina Holloway.

"SEATTLE, Aug. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies today announced that the first two features of Axon Auto-Transcribe are now available to agencies. Fredericton Police Force in Canada, Rowlett Police Department and Ector County District Attorney's office are the first to announce their deployment of Axon Auto-Transcribe as part of Axon's customer early access program. The tools, named Review Assistant and Transcription Assistant, use artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate the review and transcription of evidence, generating significant time and cost saving benefits for agencies. Instead of viewing video, audio and text as separate elements from an incident, Axon Auto-Transcribe unifies these elements into one ""hypermedia player"" enabling powerful connections and efficiencies. Axon Auto-Transcribe is available now within Axon's digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence (Evidence.com). To learn more visit: https://www.axon.com/products/auto-transcribe., , With the increasing adoption of body-worn cameras, public safety agencies face two major challenges: 1) reviewing massive amounts of video evidence to find the evidence that is pertinent to the investigation; and 2) quickly and accurately transcribing video evidence so it can move through the justice system. Axon Auto-Transcribe's new tools help to solve for these issues with the following key features:, Review Assistant uses the power of AI to create a time-synced auto-transcript for users to review versus hunting through an entire video to find the important moments. Users can search for a word within the transcript as well as click on a word to jump to that portion of the video where that word is spoken., Transcription Assistant uses the power of AI to generate an initial transcript so the user only has to focus on making corrections versus transcribing from scratch, which can take four to ten times the length of the audio being transcribed. The integration with Axon Evidence means the transcribed evidence can be efficiently shared with attorneys and courts, eliminating the need to email Word documents., Axon is developing future iterations of these products to provide even further time-saving tools for customers, such as automatic highlighting of significant events in the transcript. This will impact report writing such as supervisor video reviews and use-of-force reviews. The capabilities of Axon Auto-Transcribe will integrate with other services and products within Axon Evidence., ""Axon Auto-Transcribe allows agencies to get the maximum value out of their audio and video evidence,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""We've heard from customers that a significant amount of their time and resources is spent reviewing hundreds of hours of video footage. By developing a 'hypermedia view' of every element of an incident, we're not only creating much needed efficiencies into the evidence review and sharing process, we are also enabling our customers to get to the truth faster and with increased accuracy."", ""Investigators would complete an interview with a victim, then spend probably three, four hours transcribing,"" says Rowlett PD Lieutenant Steve Ferrie. ""Finding a solution for transcribing became a top priority — it's taking up too much time for the investigators. With Axon Auto-Transcribe, we estimate a 65-75% time savings just by being able to push a button to get a transcript. Our investigators can listen to the evidence and make changes in a fraction of the time."", ""The Axon transcription feature was very beneficial to our [[ recent homicide ]] investigation,"" says Fredericton Police Force Detective Darryl Carter. ""Most interviews were being conducted by other major crime members, and were often lengthy. Being able to read the transcript of an interview as opposed to watching hours of video proved to be vital. I saved hours of work with each interview, and was able to keep on top of information coming in quite quickly."", Review Assistant and Transcription Assistant were unveiled at the Axon Accelerate user conference, the leading global technology conference for public safety professionals across law enforcement, federal, fire, EMS and corrections. As an introduction to Axon Auto-Transcribe, customers with Axon Pro licenses will receive 100 minutes per license and customers with Axon Records licenses will receive 200 minutes for each license. Customers on Axon's Officer Safety Plan 7+ (which encompasses both Axon Pro and Axon Records offerings) will receive a starter pack of 300 minutes per license., About Axon, Axon is the global leader in connected public safety technologies. We are a mission-driven company whose overarching goal is to protect life. Our vision is a world where bullets are obsolete, where social conflict is dramatically reduced, where everyone has access to a fair and effective justice system and where racial equity, diversity and inclusion is centered in all of our work.

"SEATTLE, Aug. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies today announced six new training scenarios as part of the Axon Virtual Reality (VR) Training program. The new scenarios include officer intervention training, post-traumatic stress injury (PTSI) training for both community members and officers, Alzheimer's/Dementia training and hard of hearing training. The first two new training scenarios, both based on peer intervention, will be available to agencies in the fourth quarter of 2020 with the additional four new trainings slated to be available in the first half of 2021. For more information visit: https://www.axon.com/vr-training., , Axon's new VR training scenarios are built to address the following: building empathy with community members that police officers are assisting in the field, officer preparedness and officer coping. The first two training scenarios being made available by the end of the year address peer intervention: how an officer can best determine when to step in if he or she sees a colleague acting inappropriately. The trainee is able to see the scene unfolding from both the point-of-view of the subject as well as the point-of-view of the officer responding to the scene. One scenario features a noise complaint call involving a resident who has had previous run-ins with the police. The second scenario features a homeless man who is panhandling on business property. In both scenarios, the trainee must decide which decisions to make while working with a fellow officer who demonstrates an obvious bias towards the subjects., To develop the VR training scenarios, Axon works closely with community advocacy groups, mental health organizations, clinicians, law enforcement training experts and more. For the peer intervention training specifically, Axon worked with ABLE (Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement), a group dedicated to help prepare officers to successfully intervene to prevent harm, and EPIC (Ethical Policing is Courageous), a law enforcement peer intervention training program., ""Knowing when and how to stand up to your peers can be difficult in any industry – but especially in policing when faced with potentially volatile situations,"" says former police chief and current AI Ethics Board member, Kathleen O'Toole. ""This immersive training will be very impactful as it will train officers to recognize when peers are acting inappropriately and empower them to intervene properly, resulting in successful, non-violent outcomes."", ""After the events of this year, and the many tragic events that preceded 2020, it is clear that we need to offer law enforcement proactive versus reactive tools for reducing use of force,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""Being trained on when not to deploy force is just as important as tactical training on how to deploy force, and that is what we are addressing with these new training modules. Our mission has always been to protect life and this training is a big step towards that goal."", The complete list of Axon VR Training currently in development includes:, Officer PTSI: This training helps officers identify, mitigate and cope with traumas they may encounter when in the field.Hard of Hearing: This training helps officers to identify if a person they are addressing in the field has hearing loss and equips them with tools to communicate more effectively.Community PTSI: This training helps officers to identify if a community member is experiencing some form of PTSI and introduce strategies for better communication.Alzheimer's/Dementia: This training equips officers with strategies to better assist a person in the field who may be suffering from Alzheimer's/Dementia., The training is available to agencies as part of the Officer Safety Plan 7+, the TASER Certification Plan or a la carte., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

"SEATTLE, Aug. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today announced its partnership with Occam Video Solutions, whose flagship product, iNPUT-ACE, is a leading software used for video investigations. Public safety agencies are often overwhelmed by the task of gathering, storing and sharing an increasing amount of digital evidence. Axon's cloud-based digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence (Evidence.com), is designed to help departments manage all this data and continues to add new features and functionality. Through Axon's partnership with Occam, Axon customers will be able to convert third-party video evidence within Axon Evidence to gain a fuller picture of what happened in any given investigation. To learn more visit: https://www.axon.com/3P_Video_Playback., , Video security, closed-circuit TV (CCTV) and publicly submitted video evidence can be burdensome for law enforcement agencies to manage. Many video security systems use unique video formats that can only be played back using proprietary hardware or software. When agencies attempt to playback that video using other commercial software, the files often play incorrectly with frames being skipped entirely. The Axon Evidence integration with iNPUT-ACE, which supports most video file types, solves for this by converting files into a lossless format, ensuring that the entire picture of what happened in an incident is fully captured., Axon's partnership will utilize iNPUT-ACE's core playback and conversion engine, the Video Integration Suite (VIS), to allow for third-party video files to be played and converted within Axon Evidence. The video can then be viewed and analyzed as easily as video captured on body cameras., ""Almost all investigations today require analyzing some amount of video evidence. Whether it is CCTV, cell phone video, home surveillance systems, or law enforcement video, it's crucial that the video is played accurately,"" says former Chief of Police, Mike Burridge. ""Video evidence is collected from different video sources and each has their own unique video format. Investigators have to quickly playback video evidence and, unfortunately, this is often done with generic or unreliable tools that can create inaccurate or misleading video evidence. Agencies without video investigative solutions, like iNPUT-ACE, often unknowingly utilize this kind of evidence in the courtroom or internal investigations, and it can have devastating consequences - especially in today's climate."", ""This partnership will have a great impact on our customers and can help in further establishing trust within their communities,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""Agencies are now enabled to review, store and organize video evidence from many sources with the confidence that they are viewing correct playbacks. This is a great example of how Axon is working toward protecting truth and transparency."", ""Our mission is to empower investigators with intuitive tools, expert training, and comprehensive support to further video-centric investigations,"" says iNPUT-ACE CEO, Andrew Fredericks. ""We are thrilled to integrate our VIS API engine with Axon and ensure that every customer can review video evidence without being slowed down by the technical challenges that are common in reviewing video files."", Pricing details will be made available soon.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Aug. 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ --, Dear Shareholders,, When we began investing in body cameras in 2008, we faced numerous skeptics. But, we knew that body cameras — and the accountability and transparency they bring — were the future. And we were confident in our institutional knowledge about policing, due to our close connection to our customers through the success of our TASER devices., , , Body cameras started to gain traction after a wave of protests began in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, which was also the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement. Axon was delivering the right products at the right time and our investments in cloud software made body camera programs feasible and affordable for all agencies., In 2020, we are humbled to be developing solutions that once again find themselves relevant to a national conversation about policing. The pandemic has amplified the deep inequities in our society, with disproportionate burdens of unemployment, illness and death among Black and Brown people and historically marginalized populations. We understand and see the pain and nuance behind the demands to defund the police, which is really about reforming and reshaping the justice system. We also know that public safety is a fundamental right of all communities, and our pipeline continues to strengthen as communities see the power of our platform to drive positive change. We believe we will look back on 2020 as a time that set in motion the next wave of policing reform., Technology is not a panacea but it can have an outsized impact on creating a world where everyone feels safer in their neighborhoods, and gets home safely at the end of the day. We have the privilege to imagine how the world can and should be different and we have the capability to create and drive that change., After the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, Axon employees began to brainstorm ways to leverage our expertise to do even more in service of our mission to protect human life. We expanded our existing vision to also center on racial equity, diversity and inclusion in the justice system, and created a new position within our sales team to put a greater focus on incorporating community input into our product development process. Axon engineers are developing software that addresses the need for better data collection, accountability, investigation and compliance for force events, and helps agencies to better document, analyze and report on force incidents. We are eager to build upon our existing leadership in driving down injury rates and providing use-of-force accountability. TASER devices have the lowest likelihood of death or serious injury compared with other use-of-force options and provide the best combination of stopping power while also keeping both officers and the public safe. TASER devices also document the duration of an energy discharge, the quality of the connection and the type of deployment, and when armed, are able to trigger body-worn cameras to begin recording., This is also a year where we have walked beside our customers in one of the most challenging environments they have ever faced — whether through our personal protective equipment charitable campaign for first responders, or through helping agencies respond to and comply with demands for more transparency and source technology amid greater public budget scrutiny, we aspire to be a true partner. We are emboldened by the opportunity to continue to re-imagine public safety and support our customers and communities., Key business highlights:, Summary of Q2 2020 results:, Financial commentary by segment:, TASER:, THREE MONTHS ENDED, CHANGE, 30 JUN 2020, 31 MAR 2020, 30 JUN 2019, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Net sales, $, 70,490, $, 75,895, $, 60,572, (7.1), %, 16.4, %, Gross margin, 61.4, %, 60.1, %, 59.9, %, 130, bp, 150, bp, , Software & Sensors:, THREE MONTHS ENDED, CHANGE, 30 JUN 2020, 31 MAR 2020, 30 JUN 2019, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Axon Cloud net sales, $, 41,891, $, 39,154, $, 31,822, 7.0, %, 31.6, %, Axon Cloud gross margin, 77.9, %, 75.3, %, 73.0, %, 260, bp, 490, bp, Sensors and Other net sales, $, 28,878, $, 32,113, $, 19,968, (10.1), %, 44.6, %, Sensors and Other gross margin, 42.6, %, 42.0, %, 30.1, %, 60, bp, 1,250, bp, , Forward-looking performance indicators:, , 30 JUN 2020, 31 MAR 2020, 31 DEC 2019, 30 SEP 2019, 30 JUN 2019, ($ in thousands), Annual recurring revenue (1), $, 183,498, $, 173,919, $, 161,277, $, 141,540, $, 129,452, Net revenue retention (2), 119, %, 119, %, 121, %, *, *, Total company future contracted revenue, $, 1,340,000, $, 1,274,000, $, 1,230,000, $, 1,130,000, $, 1,050,000, Percentage of TASER devices sold on a recurring payment plan, 46, %, 43, %, 58, %, 55, %, 60, %, (1), Monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue annualized., (2), Refer to ""statistical definitions"" below., *, Not disclosed., , Current market trends and outlook:, The following forward-looking statements reflect Axon's expectations as of August 6, 2020, and are subject to substantial uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic., What we're seeing in the market:, We executed well through a challenging second quarter — while demand for our products remained robust, US domestic customers often lacked bandwidth to make purchasing decisions as they focused on personnel outages due to COVID-19, employee safety and caution about uncertain budgets. Even with these challenges, Q2 2020 revenue was generally in line with our pre-pandemic expectation., Total company quarterly bookings in Q2 2020 on contracts of five years or fewer were flat year-over year, with domestic bookings down 6% and international bookings up 36%. Domestic body camera bookings grew 13% in the quarter, with domestic COVID-19-related purchasing delays largely affecting only the TASER segment., Bookings in Q2 were strongest, on a year-over-year percentage growth basis, in international TASER and domestic Fleet, demonstrating our ability to diversify our exposure to new geographies and product segments. We are seeing the benefits of investing in geographic and customer diversity this year, especially as we realize increasing orders from corrections departments and international markets, including UK, Australia, Canada and new markets including Indonesia, Brazil, Panama, Thailand, India and Chile, to name a few., In the first weeks of Q3 2020, TASER and body camera bookings are trending ahead of April. We have a loaded pipeline for our back half and we are expecting a strong Q3 2020 and even stronger Q4 2020 — tracking toward the range we gave at the start of the year., We also have a strong pipeline of Officer Safety Plan 7+ opportunities that we expect to close in the next six months. As a reminder, OSP 7+ is our highest value bundle at $229 per officer per month for five years, and includes TASER 7, Axon Body 3 camera and a host of cloud software productivity and digital evidence management services, including Axon Records., Update on formal guidance:, For the third quarter 2020, we are managing toward revenue growth of approximately 15% year over year, supporting an Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 12%. (Q3 2020 EBITDA margin will be affected by expected shipments of lower-margin body cameras to our largest customers.), We expect our diluted share count in Q3 2020 to be approximately 64.5 million shares., In light of macro uncertainties, we are maintaining the decision we made last quarter to refrain from providing formal full year guidance. The impact of COVID-19 remains fluid, and we are monitoring state and local mandates as we approach the fall. Shut-down activity could bring renewed caution from police departments on budgeting. Thus, while our bookings are trending in a positive direction, COVID-19 risk remains. We are not seeing changes in buying activity due to police defunding concerns. We have seen some anecdotal acceleration of body camera buying decisions due to agencies wishing to provide transparency to their communities., Internal estimates & visibility:, At this time, our best estimate for our 2020 performance remains in line with our previously issued guidance, but there is enough uncertainty in how the current crisis will affect our customers that we don't feel that our internal estimates should be considered formal guidance., Axon remains confident in its long-term, multi-year outlook, and we firmly believe we will emerge from 2020 even stronger. Our confidence is supported by our strong first half 2020 performance and the state of our current pipeline, which remains robust and is more geographically diverse than ever., While our contracts are subject to appropriations risk, at this point in time, the revenue realized in 1H 2020 plus the recurring revenue under contract for the remaining two quarters gives Axon visibility into approximately 65% of the midpoint of the previously issued full-year revenue guidance range of $615 million to $625 million., Axon's mission to protect life and drive transparency and accountability in policing has motivated us for more than a decade. Whether these issues are in the foreground of national attention as they are today, or in the background, they've always been important to society, and to us. We're privileged to be working on solutions to some of society's most entrenched challenges., Signed,

    Jawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and webcast, We will host our Q2 2020 earnings conference call on Thursday, August 6 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The webcast will be available via a link on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com (https://investor.axon.com/), or can be accessed directly via https://axon.zoom.us/j/92337281166., Statistical Definitions, Dollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers. We calculate it as the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of agency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This calculation includes high-margin warranty but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription contingent of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments -- meaning that for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is 
    the global leader in connected public safety technologies. We are
     a mission-driven company whose overarching goal is to protect life.

You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC., Update on Legal Matters:, Axon v. FTC, Axon continues to both vigorously prosecute its Federal court case against the FTC and defend the FTC's separate administrative action against the company. The FTC's administrative action had been stayed until July 7, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but discovery has resumed and the administrative hearing is scheduled to begin on October 13, 2020. Separately, Axon's case against the FTC was dismissed on April 8, 2020, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction, holding that Axon must first bring its constitutional claims through the FTC's administrative process. Axon appealed that ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (No. 20-15662), which granted expedited consideration and held oral argument on July 17, 2020. Copies of Axon's Federal Court filings, including its most recent appellate brief, can be found on Axon's FTC Investor Briefing page at https://www.axon.com/ftc. In parallel to these matters, Axon is evaluating strategic alternatives to litigation, which Axon might pursue if determined to be in the best interests of shareholders and customers. This could include a divestiture of the Vievu entity and/or related assets. While Axon continues to believe the acquisition of Vievu in 2018 was lawful and a benefit to Vievu's customers, the cost, risk and distraction of protracted litigation merit consideration of settlement if achievable on terms agreeable to the FTC and Axon. As of Q2 2020, Vievu software licenses represented approximately 4% of Axon's annual recurring revenue of $183 million., For investor relations information please contact Andrea James via email at IR@axon.com., , , AXON ENTERPRISE, INC.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 13, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today announced the industry's first real-time mobile application that allows law enforcement to use a mobile device to remotely view live streamed Axon Body 3 camera or Axon Air drone footage. The Axon Aware app is bundled with and available at zero additional cost for all OSP7+ subscription plan customers, as well as all a la carte customers who have purchased Aware/Aware+ or Axon Air., , Axon Aware is a critical new tool for public safety because one in four calls for service has a high chance of escalation. Axon Aware uniquely empowers responding officers to connect with support teams in real-time, both when they proactively ask for help to ""watch their back,"" and driven by signal alerts within the Axon network. Launched in September 2019, Aware is built into Axon's latest generation of devices and services, including the Axon Body 3 camera and the Axon Air service for drone pilots. Aware has already proven to be a game changer for early adopters, such as the Cincinnati Police Department, which is using live-streaming capability to provide real-time intelligence to their crime center. And starting today, the Aware mobile app brings these same real-time benefits directly to the mobile devices of other critical support team members such as sergeants and commanders, regardless of where they are or what they are busy with at the moment., ""The Axon Aware application with Axon Signal alerts will significantly improve police officer safety through real-time location and body-worn camera live-streaming during critical incidents,"" says Cincinnati PD's Sgt. Ryan Smith., Using Axon's Signal technology, an alert is sent to the mobile app when a firearm is removed from an officer's holster or a TASER device is armed. The live stream of the body camera or drone footage can be accessed remotely and can help the support team learn more about the officer's location and situation as it unfolds, allowing everyone to make more informed decisions about what resources and support to provide., ""We're proud to extend our real-time live stream capabilities to a remote viewing experience via the app for those times when officers aren't sitting in front of a computer back at the station and want to receive intelligence that they can act upon,"" says Director of Axon Aware Kevin Shah. ""Today, we are providing better situational awareness and support to more than 40 agencies that are currently trialing or using the app."", All of the features on the Axon Aware app are backed by the digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence (Evidence.com). The app supports all mobile devices, including tablets, that run on iOS 11+ and Android 6+ and is available for download on the App Store and Google Play Store. To learn more about the Axon Aware app, please visit https://help.axon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046931074-Axon-Aware-Mobile-App-Overview., The Axon Aware app is available in the U.S. for Axon Body 3 and Axon Air customers. In Canada and the United Kingdom, the Aware app is available for Axon Air customers immediately and will be available for Axon Body 3 customers in the future., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders., , Dear Shareholders,, The first several months of 2020 are proving that Axon is resilient. You can see this in our adaptability to change, in the solutions-oriented culture embodied by our dedicated employees, and in our financial position., For more than 25 years, Axon has been dedicated to serving those who protect and serve. Now, as always, our public safety customers are on the front lines of protecting the public, and sadly, too many of them have lost their lives to COVID-19. Axon mourns for fallen officers and their families, and we have pivoted to dedicate a portion of our supply chain to source critical safety equipment such as masks, gloves and hand sanitizer for first responders., We continue to ship our hardware products at volume. Axon is viewed as ""mission critical"" under Department of Homeland Security guidelines and we hear this in feedback from our customers. We are focused on keeping our manufacturing lines open and our employees and customers safe., Our cloud-based software has proven more useful than ever in supporting public safety and promoting social distancing. In March, we began providing global access to the full feature set of Axon Citizen, free of cost this year, to every agency that is not already using it. Axon Citizen enables virtual evidence collection, eliminating the need for officers to have to collect digital files in person and reducing the need for community members to visit a station., Axon's core business remains robust and healthy, as seen in our Q1 2020 results, with revenue up 27% year over year. Particularly noteworthy was international revenue growth of 38%, driven by strong sales in the UK, Australia and Canada and sales to new, untapped international markets in Asia and Latin America — the direct result of our targeted investments in sales channel expansion. We discuss current market trends in our Outlook section., We have a big mission to fulfill, which supports our robust long-term revenue growth and profitability goals. Axon is on track to complete record hiring through the first six months of this year, and we continue to attract bar-raising technology talent from the world's other top innovators., Our strategic priorities in 2020 are to continue to execute in our core market, while accelerating our path-to-market in new product categories such as productivity (Records) and communications (Dispatch), and expanding to new customer categories, such as corrections, U.S. federal agencies and new international markets., Axon's response to COVID-19:, We have been clear-eyed about the challenges surrounding COVID-19 and we aspire to lead from the front. We certainly do not celebrate difficult times, but we do see them as challenges that can bring out the greatness in people and companies. We believe Axon will emerge from this crisis even stronger., Customer support: We are supporting our customers through a period of upheaval, doing our best to be a stable and reliable partner in this storm. Initiatives include:, Employee safety & manufacturing: Axon takes health and safety seriously, and our entire mission is to protect life. Just days after our last quarterly update, we curbed all non-essential employee travel and then quickly moved to support our information workers to do their jobs from home., Our customers are counting on us to deliver TASER 7 and Axon body cameras. We are proud to be able to ensure that first responders have the tools they need to keep society safe and orderly. Early on in the US outbreak, Axon management was in discussions with local authorities and our Board, particularly Dr. Richard Carmona, the former US Surgeon General, and determined that the best course of action was to keep our critical manufacturing lines open to satisfy customer demand., We've also taken steps to mitigate contamination risk in our facilities. This includes staggering work schedules, proactively sending high-risk groups home with pay, providing access to a registered nurse on site and increasing our cleaning standards to a level that exceeds CDC guidance., Supply chain: We have adapted well to ongoing challenges. In 2019, we took action to diversify our supply chain and global manufacturing footprint. Those initiatives positioned us well to handle COVID-19, enabling us to produce and ship our critical core products with little to no interruption. While we feel confident in our preparations, there are still many unforeseen challenges that lay ahead. We continue to manage through supply chain disruptions, finding alternate sources when available or working with foreign regulators to ensure that our suppliers can provide parts. We elevated our inventory build in Q1 2020 and are continuing to do so over the course of 2020, which is a proactive approach to building safety stock in an effort to minimize shipping disruptions. We are committed to working through challenges as they arise to support our customers and deliver mission critical equipment., Shareholder engagement: We have pivoted our shareholder engagement to a virtual format. Our annual meeting, scheduled for May 29, will be held online at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/AAXN2020, and we will be participating in several upcoming investor conferences utilizing video conferencing. All investor materials and events are available at investor.axon.com., Progress on our core initiatives:, Summary of Q1 2020 results:, Financial commentary by segment:, TASER:, THREE MONTHS ENDED, CHANGE, 31 MAR 2020, 31 DEC 2019, 31 MAR 2019, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Net sales, $, 75,895, $, 83,955, $, 65,391, (9.6), %, 16.1, %, Gross margin, 60.1, %, 60.5, %, 64.4, %, (40), bp, (430), bp, , Software & Sensors:, THREE MONTHS ENDED, CHANGE, 31 MAR 2020, 31 DEC 2019, 31 MAR 2019, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Axon Cloud net sales, $, 39,154, $, 36,805, $, 27,631, 6.4, %, 41.7, %, Axon Cloud gross margin, 75.3, %, 76.1, %, 73.6, %, (80), bp, 170, bp, Sensors and Other net sales, $, 32,113, $, 51,091, $, 22,788, (37.1), %, 40.9, %, Sensors and Other gross margin, 42.0, %, 27.0, %, 28.4, %, 1,500, bp, 1,360, bp, , Forward-Looking Performance Indicators:, 31 MAR 2020, 31 DEC 2019, 30 SEP 2019, 30 JUN 2019, 31 MAR 2019, ($in thousands), Annual recurring revenue (1), $, 173,919, $, 161,277, $, 141,540, $, 129,452, $, 122,276, Total company future contracted revenue, $, 1,274,000, $, 1,230,000, $, 1,130,000, $, 1,050,000, $, 930,000, Percentage of TASER devices sold on a recurring payment plan, 43, %, 58, %, 55, %, 60, %, 42, %, ____________________________, (1), Monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue annualized., , Current market trends and outlook:, The following forward-looking statements reflect Axon's expectations as of May 7, 2020, and are subject to substantial uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic., What we're seeing in the market: To date, we are seeing mixed changes to buying habits among major US city police departments — some departments are continuing to place large orders for Axon products, and communicating gratitude that we are shipping mission critical equipment. We are seeing some agencies move to standard issue on Axon devices, to reduce sharing among officers, which has boosted orders., A small number of agency customers have delayed their body camera programs, or postponed their subscription upgrades until unspecified later dates. Thus far, the impact of these COVID-19-related order delays to our full-year projections have been more than offset by a stronger-than-expected Q1 2020, better-than-expected international TASER orders realized through May 2020, and a strengthening Federal pipeline., Through May, Axon has been executing upon orders from countries with which Axon has not historically done business, and this widening customer base is providing new revenue opportunities. So far in 2020, Axon has received body camera and TASER orders from Latin America, Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia — all representing new country markets — and we are also seeing stronger-than-average order activity in the UK., We have also been encouraged by the speed with which the federal government has provided financial support to public safety. It is still early in the federal response, and the 2020 CARES Act contains $850 million in grants to state and local law enforcement, through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG), which is already more proactive than what we saw in the global economic recession of 2008-2009, as the first JAG grant then didn't occur until 2009. In addition, the early phase COVID-19 stimulus packages included $150 million for federal law enforcement., Withdrawing formal guidance: Given the number of factors outside of Axon's control, we are withdrawing our previously provided formal full year guidance of $100 million to $105 million in Adjusted EBITDA on revenue of $615 million to $625 million, as we closely monitor municipal budgets and their potential impact on customer procurement cycles, which could materially alter our pipeline. While municipal government budget appropriations have not been a historical challenge for Axon, the severity of the economic slowdown related to COVID-19 increases appropriations risk., Internal estimates & visibility: At this time, our best estimate for our 2020 performance remains in line with our previously issued guidance, but there is enough uncertainty in how the current crisis will affect our customers that we don't feel that our internal estimates should be considered formal guidance., Axon remains confident in its long-term, multi-year outlook, and we firmly believe we will emerge from the COVID-19 crisis even stronger. Our confidence is supported by our strong Q1 2020 performance and the state of our current pipeline, which remains robust and is more geographically diverse than ever. While our contracts are subject to appropriations risk, at this point in time, the revenue realized in Q1 2020 plus the recurring revenue under contract for the remaining three quarters gives Axon visibility into approximately 50% of the midpoint of the previously issued full-year revenue guidance range., Axon is proud to be taking care of our customers, our employees, and our societal stakeholders. We feel confident we will one day look back at 2020 as a pivotal year where we not only rose to the challenge, but we accelerated progress and created new opportunities. More importantly, we extended a hand to help our customers and their communities when it mattered., Signed,Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and Webcast, We will host our Q1 2020 earnings conference call on May 7 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The webcast will be available via a link on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com (https://investor.axon.com/), or can be accessed directly via https://axon.zoom.us/j/92548816017., Statistical Definitions, Dollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers. We calculate it as the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of agency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This calculation includes high-margin warranty but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription contingent of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments -- meaning that for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is a mission-driven company whose overarching goal is to protect life. Our vision is a world where bullets are obsolete, where social conflict is dramatically reduced, and where everyone has access to a fair and effective justice system.

Axon, On April 22, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (No. 19-2065) affirmed the Kansas district court's non-infringement ruling and entered judgment on Digital's appeal in favor of Axon. This ruling effectively ends this litigation filed in January 2016. Digital had claimed that Axon's Signal Technology infringed its '452 Patent. The court of appeals ruling may be found at https://www.axon.com/legal., Axon v. FTC, Axon continues to both vigorously prosecute its Federal court case against the FTC and defend the FTC's separate administrative action against the company. Presently, the FTC's administrative action has been stayed until June 3, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the hearing has been rescheduled to September 9, 2020. Separately, Axon's case against the FTC was dismissed on April 8, 2020, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction, holding that Axon must first bring its constitutional claims through the FTC's administrative process. Axon has appealed that ruling to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (No. 20-15662), which has granted expedited consideration and set oral argument for July 17, 2020. A copy of Axon's appellate brief can be found on Axon's FTC Investor Briefing page at https://www.axon.com/ftc.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 2, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in public safety technologies, announced today it has entered into a commercial partnership with Flock Safety, a venture-backed provider of advanced security for neighborhoods and law enforcement., , Axon is making it easier and more cost effective for police departments to deploy a network of both fixed and mobile automated license plate reader (ALPR) capabilities by offering Flock Safety's industry-leading fixed ALPR solution alongside Axon's upcoming Axon Fleet 3 in-car video and mobile ALPR solution. Learn more by visiting axon.com/flocksafety., Last year, Axon announced plans to develop and integrate ALPR capability into its Axon Fleet 3 in-car video system. Axon is improving the traditional ALPR model by leveraging AI to reduce cost, making it affordable for police departments to deploy ALPR in every vehicle. Axon is ethically designing its ALPR solution to improve data security, transparency, and privacy relative to historical legacy solutions., Flock Safety's wireless camera systems are being used in a growing number of neighborhoods across the United States. They use the world's first Vehicle Fingerprint technology to identify the unique features of a suspect vehicle, including make, model, color, and license plate, allowing police to track leads and solve crimes. In some cities, the presence of Flock Safety has contributed to a reduction in vehicle thefts by more than 60%, as reported by local police., ""Most US law enforcement agencies already use ALPR, but today's solutions are not designed with ethics in mind. They are also far too expensive to be deployed on enough vehicles for great coverage—a single camera can only be in one place at one time,"" said Jeff Kunins, Axon's Chief Product Officer and Executive Vice President of Software. ""We are excited to partner with Flock Safety, who, like us, has built an ALPR solution that is disruptively more affordable and built from the ground up with an ethical design framework. With Axon Fleet 3 and Flock Safety, agencies and neighborhoods can affordably deploy a smart mesh of ALPR protection to keep their communities safer, while providing greater transparency and accountability."", ""We are thrilled to partner with Axon and join forces in its mission to protect life. Axon is the definitive market leader in public safety technology and brings an unmatched scale of trusted law enforcement relationships,"" said Flock CEO and founder Garrett Langley. ""We've designed Flock Safety's ALPR with ethics and privacy in mind, and we are proud to join Axon in its commitment to these ideals."", Axon's sales team will help Flock Safety provide law enforcement agencies access to their camera system-enabled ALPR technology, which will provide integrated capabilities with Axon's Fleet 3 system launching later this year. To learn more, law enforcement agencies can sign up to attend a joint CEO Roundtable with Axon CEO and founder Rick Smith and Flock CEO Garrett Langley, by visiting axon.com/flocksafety., Axon is also making a minority, non-controlling investment in Flock with the ability to commit additional capital over time through warrants conditional on certain partnership performance metrics. As part of the investment terms, Flock Safety has committed to collaborating with Axon's independent AI Ethics Board., The financial terms of the investment were not disclosed and are not material relative to Axon's cash and investments on hand as of the end of 2019. ""This strategic investment is an innovative and financially disciplined approach to staying at the forefront of innovation in public safety and preserving Axon's optionality for future growth,"" Axon CFO Jawad Ahsan concluded., About Flock Safety, Flock Safety is a crime-solving company that provides the most advanced and affordable security for neighborhoods, small businesses, and law enforcement.

"Police officers and other emergency responders can now use Axon Citizen to collect, manage and share community digital evidence while maintaining social distance, SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 26, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN) announced today that, in the interest of public health, it is providing global access to the full feature set of Axon Citizen, at no cost this year, to every agency that is not currently using the digital evidence platform., , With this tool, officers can gather digital evidence from the community by sending a personalized link via text message or email from Axon's digital evidence management platform, Axon Evidence, or the Axon Capture mobile app. This eliminates the need for in-person interaction and helps to minimize officer exposure to COVID-19. Agencies can learn more at www.axon.com/joinforces., Whether officers are being asked to stay home or respond to calls in their community, Axon is proud to offer a solution that allows officers to continue to do their jobs while still maintaining social distance.

By enabling virtual evidence collection, we can immediately help first responders and public safety officials reduce their exposure to COVID-19,"" says Axon's CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""We're providing agencies around the world open access to Axon Citizen during this crisis so officers can avoid collecting digital files in person."", Today, officers may interact with members of the public to collect digital evidence like photos, videos or other data. But during the current period of social distancing, these interactions for non-urgent evidence collection can put officers and citizens at risk. Axon Citizen radically simplifies evidence collection and allows officers to collect and manage community evidence from a mobile or desktop device. The intuitive interface allows critical evidence to be securely submitted into Axon Evidence in three clicks, where the software's features can be used to easily create a chain of custody and assess, catalog and search footage., Before this emergency access program, Axon Citizen was available only to Evidence.com Pro license customers and Officer Safety Plan 7+ customers, or as a separate purchase., Axon CEO and founder Rick Smith will be hosting a live video webinar on Friday, March 27, 2020 at 10:00 am Pacific / 1:00 pm Eastern to share more details.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 27, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders., , Dear Shareholders,, We are pleased to report a strong finish to 2019., Revenue grew 26% to $531 million for the year, driven by demand for our latest generation camera, Axon Body 3, the cloud-connected TASER 7, and our cloud software., Bottom line performance reflects our ability to scale manufacturing of TASER 7, continued growth of higher margin Axon Cloud revenue (up 41% for the full year), and cost control discipline. While net income was affected by catch-up stock compensation expense, we delivered a record $88 million in adjusted EBITDA for the full year, up 43%, and Q4 2019 adjusted EBITDA more than tripled to $38 million, reflecting a 22% margin., The successful launch of Axon Body 3 drove record Q4 2019 sales of $172 million, up 50%, and holds tremendous strategic value. Customers are enthusiastic about better core performance and situational awareness features such as live-video streaming and real-time alerts. With LTE connectivity, GPS and a more powerful CPU for edge-AI processing, Axon Body 3 is designed to improve officer performance and drive adoption of SaaS features. Importantly, this is expected to fuel continued growth in annual recurring SaaS revenue. Axon Body 3's communications capabilities also pave the way for adoption of the emergency dispatch solution we are bringing to market this year., Our strategic focus on driving recurring cash flow and building a self-reinforcing SaaS-centric business is working. For example, in 2019:, We continue to see customer enthusiasm for Axon Records, which underscores the effectiveness of our go-to-market strategy. We've made it attractive for agencies to start using Records by including it as a built-in benefit to our highest tier Officer Safety Plan — and some agencies will be able to fund the majority of their upgrade to that tier with savings from transitioning their legacy records management system to Axon Records., Our strategic priorities in 2020 include continuing to execute in our core market, while accelerating our path-to-market in new product categories such as de-escalation and communications, and expanding to new customer categories. This will position us to achieve a higher level of annual recurring SaaS revenue over the long term. Specifically:, Unlocking new opportunities means Axon's strategic growth areas have evolved and expanded into:, By 2030, we believe:, Summary of Q4 2019 results:, Financial commentary by segment:, TASER:, THREE MONTHS ENDED, CHANGE, 31 DEC 2019, 30 SEP 2019, 31 DEC 2018, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Net sales, $, 83,955, $, 71,743, $, 65,301, 17.0, %, 28.6, %, Gross margin, 60.5, %, 63.1, %, 65.0, %, -260bp, -450bp, Software & Sensors:, THREE MONTHS ENDED, CHANGE, 31 DEC 2019, 30 SEP 2019, 31 DEC 2018, QoQ, YoY, (in thousands), Axon Cloud net sales, $, 36,805, $, 34,021, $, 25,774, 8.2, %, 42.8, %, Axon Cloud gross margin, 76.1, %, 75.8, %, 74.5, %, 30bp, 160bp, Sensors and Other net sales, $, 51,091, $, 25,073, $, 23,716, 103.8, %, 115.4, %, Sensors and Other gross margin, 27.0, %, 36.4, %, 15.7, %, -940bp, 1,130bp, Forward-Looking Performance Indicators:, 31 DEC 2019, 30 SEP 2019, 30 JUN 2019, 31 MAR 2019, 31 DEC 2018, ($ in thousands), Annual recurring revenue (1), $, 161,277, $, 141,540, $, 129,452, $, 122,276, $, 108,496, Total company future contracted revenue, $, 1,230,000, $, 1,130,000, $, 1,050,000, $, 930,000, $, 900,000, Percentage of TASER devices sold on a recurring payment plan, 58, %, 55, %, 60, %, 42, %, 35, %, (1) Monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue annualized., Outlook:, For the full year 2020, we expect to achieve:, This is an exciting time for Axon and its customers -- the products we are bringing to market are fundamentally improving public safety, creating massive societal value, and saving lives. Thank you for joining us on this journey., Signed,Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and Webcast, We will host our Q4 2019 earnings conference call on February 27 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com., Statistical Definitions, Software and Sensors bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software and Sensors hardware, software and Axon Evidence. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, inclusive of renewals, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods., Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings., For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words., We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: our ability to design, introduce and sell new products or features; our ability to defend against litigation and protect our intellectual property, and the resulting costs of this activity; our ability to manage our supply chain and avoid production delays, shortages, and impacts to expected gross margins; the impact of stock compensation expense, impairment expense, and income tax expense on our financial results; customer purchase behavior, including adoption of our software as a service delivery model; our exposure to cancellations of government contracts due to appropriation clauses, exercise of a cancellation clause, or non-exercise of contractually optional periods; negative media publicity regarding our products; the impact of product mix on projected gross margins; defects in our products; changes in the costs of product components and labor; loss of customer data, a breach of security, or an extended outage, including our reliance on third party cloud-based storage providers; exposure to international operational risks; delayed cash collections and possible credit losses due to our subscription model; changes in government regulations in the U.S. and in foreign markets, especially related to the classification of our product by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and to evolving regulations surrounding privacy and data protection; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and counter-party risks relating to cash balances held in excess of FDIC insurance limits. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K lists various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These factors are intended as cautionary statements for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Readers can find them under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and investors should refer to them. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties., Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 20, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today announced a new drone piloting and livestreaming application that allows law enforcement to livestream critical data directly into Axon's digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence (Evidence.com). The Escondido Police Department in California was the first to use the application., , The first-of-its kind Axon Air app allows law enforcement to stream drone footage to command staff and into Axon Evidence in near real-time. The data is protected by the same rigorous data management system and chain of custody protocols that law enforcement agencies trust for body-worn, in-car and in-room video systems. Axon partnered with a network of agencies to develop the app, which includes customizable piloting controls and settings — about 30 agencies are using it in the field., ""We are excited to have a flight app that streamlines our workflow. From livestreaming in the moment to capturing the Evidence in a secure system, it makes our jobs easier and keeps everything consistent,"" says Escondido PD's Drone Program Coordinator and Chief Pilot, Sergeant Craig Miller. ""Our pilots love the simple interface and the streaming allows us to get widespread awareness on any critical incident — the Axon Air app has been a game-changer."", Drone technology is an important tool for Escondido Police in keeping its community safe — used in standard patrol activities, overseeing SWAT operations from above, aiding in missing people searches, gaining critical insights into traffic scenes, and used in city planning efforts., ""Drone technology is very valuable to public safety, but law enforcement officers have specific end-to-end needs that Axon is committed to serving,"" says Axon CEO and founder, Rick Smith. ""We will continue to partner with departments such as Escondido to deliver advanced situational awareness technology, automated pilot and flight records, advancements in scene reconstruction and more. Our goal is to make drone use easy and seamless, so agencies can take advantage of all the benefits of a drone program."", Axon Air is Axon's suite of software solutions for unmanned aircraft use in public safety. By leveraging the Axon Evidence platform, Axon Air gives public safety agencies another tool to improve officer and community safety. Integration with Axon Aware brings livestreaming and situational awareness beyond the body camera and into the sky. Through a strategic partnership with DJI — the global leader in civilian drones and aerial imaging technology — Axon Air software is tailored specifically to public safety use cases. The new piloting and livestreaming features of the Axon Air application are compatible with the Mavic 2 Enterprise and Matrice 200 series drones and accessories. Agencies can use their existing DJI drones or purchase them directly through Axon., For more information on Axon Air visit: https://www.axon.com/products/axon-air or contact Axonair@axon.com., About Axon, Axon is a network of devices, apps and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Jan. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AAXN), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, today filed a lawsuit in Phoenix in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In its 29-page complaint, Axon asked the court to declare the FTC's structure and administrative procedures unconstitutional, and enjoin the Commission from subjecting Axon to its unfair internal forum and instead adjudicate the legality of the Vievu acquisition in a federal court., , At dispute is the FTC's use of an internal administrative proceeding that Axon alleges violates its Constitutional rights to Due Process and Equal Protection of law. In August 2018, Axon disclosed an FTC investigation into its acquisition of Vievu — a small, failing company acquired for only $7 million in cash and stock plus up to $6 million in potential earn-outs along with a holster supply agreement., The complaint alleges that on December 23, 2019, the FTC issued an extraordinary ultimatum, demanding Axon to not only divest the assets acquired in the Vievu acquisition, but to also surrender its independently created intellectual property as part of a ""blank check"" to create a competing spin-off, or else face an unconstitutional proceeding in which the FTC serves the simultaneous roles of prosecutor, judge and jury. In other words, the FTC is seeking to deprive Axon of its intellectual property without Due Process, an unprecedented strong-arm position that should send a chilling message to the nation's technology-based industries., ""No one should ever face the prospect of a government that can demand to seize your most precious assets without the ability to defend yourself in a fair and impartial court of law,"" said Rick Smith, CEO and founder of Axon. ""If the FTC believes it has a strong case against us, it should prove it in federal court before a neutral judge. Our action today seeks to ensure that will happen."", In addition to demonstrating the FTC's alleged violation of Articles II and III of the U.S. Constitution, Axon's complaint alleges that Vievu was a failing company (with a mountain of debt and only 3 days of cash) before its 2018 acquisition by Axon, and that the market for body cameras and digital evidence has remained competitive, with ten competitors winning at least 55 sizable agency deals since the acquisition., ""Our entire business serves the justice system. So, we understand the critical importance of the right to a fair and impartial trial before an unbiased court. We have unwavering resolve to seek justice,"" concluded Smith., A copy of Axon's Complaint is available at www.Axon.com/ftc., About Axon, Axon is a global network of devices, apps, training and people that helps public safety personnel become smarter and safer. With a mission of protecting life, our technologies give customers the confidence, focus and time they need to protect their communities.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., May 6, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --, , Dear Shareholders,, We are pleased with our robust start to 2021. Revenue growth of 33% in the quarter exceeded our expectations and drove increased profitability, as we executed upon growing demand for TASER devices and software-heavy body camera bundles. Solid Q1 gross margin reflects a combination of strong TASER demand and fixed-cost leverage on higher-than-expected revenue, which also flowed through to the bottom line., We are seeing healthy demand for new products, with new products bookings up 130% year over year, driven by productivity and real-time operations software solutions, VR training and transcription services. We are also successfully expanding into new markets, with new market bookings up 35% year over year., Customers — and increasingly, communities, too — see us as a leader and key partner in the global drive to transform public safety. We hear stories daily about customers using our products to save lives and protect communities. Our software usage metrics are hitting new highs, and customers are enthusiastically supporting our mission to protect life and make the bullet obsolete., As communities call for more public safety transparency, not only to record all interactions with the public but also to make reporting more transparent, we are helping agencies meet the critical needs of their communities. Our software products such as Axon Performance help agencies manage compliance with body-camera usage policies and foster greater transparency. In fact, data shows that Axon Performance is driving body-camera usage. For example, we've documented customers who have improved from recording only about half of their interactions with the public, to recording nearly four out of every five interactions, after implementing Axon Performance software., ""We deployed body-worn cameras to promote transparency and legitimacy in our community and we are committed to being accountable to the community we serve. Axon Performance is a key part of making sure the officers' cameras are on and recording when they should be. The Performance metrics have allowed officers and supervisors to monitor camera activations, and over the last nine months our activation rates have increased from 54% to 78%."" --Kristofer Jenny, Police Sergeant at Napa Police Department, April 2021, Select Q1 2021 highlights, Our teams are executing on our 2021 strategic priorities of growing our core, scaling new products, unlocking new markets and driving efficiency to fuel growth., Scaling new products:, Axon Fleet 3 beta trial underway, ALPR demand exceeding expectations: In April, we began beta testing our new AI-powered Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) technology at four agencies. We expect to launch Fleet 3 later this year featuring ALPR notifications and Respond for Devices with location updates and livestreaming. Our Fleet 3 backlog of orders has grown to more than 60 agencies and more than 2,500 vehicles, representing $25 million in bookings and higher-than-expected demand for our premium Fleet 3 bundle that includes subscriptions to both ALPR and Respond live streaming from the Fleet cameras., Axon Fleet 3 with Advanced License Plate Reading (ALPR)Axon Fleet 3's AI-powered camera system for ALPR makes it disruptively affordable enough for agencies to equip every patrol car. ALPR is a software subscription add-on that helps to reduce officer distraction and is useful for finding missing children and recovering stolen vehicles. Axon Fleet 3 will integrate ALPR capability in the dashboard camera of every patrol vehicle, allowing agencies to deploy more coverage at a fraction of the cost. Fleet 3 will also enable real-time telemetry and video streaming capabilities and will be compatible with 5G to leverage low-latency connectivity for enhanced real-time services and direct video offload to the cloud. We are simultaneously addressing industry shortcomings to improve data security, transparency and privacy as declining costs enable more widespread use of the technology., Baltimore PD on track to become the largest agency to deploy Axon Records: Axon has conducted comprehensive in-person acceptance testing with users representing a diverse range of agency roles. Customer feedback is positive about the product's ease of use and the increased efficiency that the agency will gain. Training for officers on how to use the new system is underway and we are preparing for launch in the coming weeks., Respond for Devices momentum continues to grow: Hundreds of agencies representing more than 60,000 sworn officers are now using Respond for Devices each month, including our newest feature, Priority Evidence Upload. This allows officers to immediately upload critical evidence over LTE right from their camera rather than waiting to get back to the station to dock their camera or separately connect to an app on their PC or phone. Moreover, our beta of the AutoTranscribe Digital Notepad lets Respond for Devices customers automatically upload all of the audio from their recordings over LTE. As a result, transcriptions are available immediately, enabling officers to expedite report writing rather than waiting until the end of their shift., Unlocking new markets:, Growing international pipeline: Our deal pipeline in international markets is robust, with the largest new deal activity in Q1 2021 coming from Canada, the UK, Hungary, Brazil and New Zealand. We achieved exciting milestones in Italy with the municipal police departments of the cities of Venice and Udine becoming the first agencies to equip officers with TASER devices and Axon software licenses, and the local police in Latisana, Riviera Friulana becoming the first city to adopt Axon Fleet 2 along with our Interview solution. Meanwhile, the government of Ontario, Canada became the first province to deploy Axon Evidence across public safety agencies, highlighting the growing utility of our cloud software platform. Additionally, Axon completed a cyber security review from the Australian government, fulfilling a requirement from the country's federal and defense customers to provide an added level of security and assurances and enabling broader adoption of Axon's cloud solutions in Australia., Driving efficiency:, Investments drive TASER device capacity, gross margin improvements: We are building additional manufacturing capacity to support our TASER device and cartridge manufacturing lines, in response to growing International and Federal demand and an increased install base. Investments so far in 2021 have resulted in an approximately 40% capacity increase in TASER 7 propulsion module and cartridge line production capacity, combined with greater per-person efficiency that will generate $1 million in gross cost annual run rate savings on the TASER 7. Thus far in 2021, TASER segment manufacturing and supply chain improvements are on track to result in more than $4 million in gross costs savings this year. Segment gross margins may continue to fluctuate based on customer and product mix., Leveraging the Axon platform: An update on strategic partnerships and investments, To build the public safety ecosystem of the future, Axon is aligning with other innovators and technology disrupters. Our recently announced strategic partnership with Skydio, for instance, makes Skydio drones and autonomy software solutions available to agencies through Axon. This relationship paves the way for the integration of Skydio's offerings with Axon's product suite, which will drive ground-breaking evidence management, real-time situational awareness and scene reconstruction capabilities for agencies., Axon's recent partnerships and investments are reflective of our vision to become synonymous with public safety — and equally important, allow us to leverage and expand our platform in a transformative manner. Our expanding ecosystem relationships are driven by our focus on customers and their growing needs for digital evidence management and real-time operations., Summary of Q1 2021 results:, Financial commentary by segment:

As our investments are yielding results ahead of our expectations thus far in 2021, we intend to continue investing for growth., Our updated 2021 outlook is as follows:, Thank you for joining us on our growth journey,, Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and webcast, We will host our Q1 2021 earnings conference call webinar on Thursday, May 6 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The webcast will be available via a link on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com (https://investor.axon.com/), or can be accessed directly via https://axon.zoom.us/j/92356790862., Statistical Definitions, Bookings: We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, inclusive of renewals, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided, so long as they are expected to occur within five years. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods. Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although we have entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipate the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate funds in future year budgets, or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings. Bookings, as presented here, represent total company bookings inclusive of all products, and should not be confused with our historical reported measure of Software & Sensors bookings, which excluded TASER-related bookings. Certain customers sign contracts for time periods longer than five-years, which generates a larger-sized booking — but the expected exercise amounts after the five-year period is not included in bookings, as described here, in order to facilitate comparisons between periods., Net revenue retention: Dollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers. We calculate it as the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of agency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This calculation includes high-margin warranty but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription contingent of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments -- meaning that for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution. For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Total company future contracted revenue: Total company future contracted revenue includes both recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. The remaining performance obligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606 as of March 31, 2021. We expect to recognize between 20% - 25% of this balance over the next twelve months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following five to seven years, subject to risks related to delayed deployments, budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is the global leader in connected public safety technologies.

You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC., Update on Legal Matters:, Axon v. FTC, Axon continues to both vigorously prosecute its Federal court constitutional case against the FTC and defend the FTC's separate antitrust administrative action against the company.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has stayed the FTC's administrative hearing that was scheduled to begin in October 2020., As background, Axon's Federal court constitutional challenge against the FTC was dismissed in April 2020, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction, holding that Axon must first bring its claims through the FTC's administrative process. Axon appealed that ruling to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-15662). In January 2021, a Ninth Circuit panel in a 2-1 split decision affirmed the district court ruling against Axon on the jurisdictional question., In March 2021, Axon filed a petition for rehearing en banc, which was supported by multiple amicus briefs filed by the Atlantic Legal Foundation, the Washington Legal Foundation, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, the US Chamber of Commerce, and New Civil Liberties Alliance. The petition argued that the panel's majority opinion conflicts with both Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit precedent., The Court denied rehearing but granted Axon's motion to stay the appellate mandate pending the filing of a certiorari petition with the U.S. Supreme Court. That petition is due by September 13, 2021. The FTC's administrative case will remain stayed throughout the course of the Supreme Court proceedings., Links to all Court filings and opinions can be found on Axon's FTC Investor Briefing page at https://www.axon.com/ftc., As a reminder, in parallel to these matters Axon is evaluating strategic alternatives to litigation, which Axon might pursue if determined to be in the best interests of shareholders and customers. This could include a divestiture of the Vievu entity and/or related assets. While Axon continues to believe the 2018 acquisition of Vievu was lawful and a benefit to Vievu's customers, the cost, risk and distraction of protracted litigation merit consideration of settlement if achievable on terms agreeable to the FTC and Axon, For investor relations information please contact Andrea James and Angel Ambrosio via email at IR@axon.com., , AXON ENTERPRISE, INC., CONSOLIDATED

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. and NEW YORK, April 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AXON), the global leader in public safety technologies, and RapidSOS announced today a partnership to provide emergency first responders and 911 telecommunicators access to critical emergency incident information from Axon devices being used by law enforcement officers., , Today, telecommunicators are often forced to rely on outdated 911 infrastructure, voice-only communication and manual processes to coordinate emergency responses. Through this partnership, Emergency Communications Centers across the U.S. will be eligible to access the location of officers, real-time alerts resulting from developing situations, and streaming video through Axon Respond devices such as Axon body-worn cameras, Axon Fleet in-car cameras, and Axon Air connected drones., Additionally, emergency intelligence data from more than 350 million connected devices recognized as RapidSOS Ready will be available to dispatchers and first responders via Axon Respond.

""This collaboration furthers RapidSOS's mission to support first responders and the communities they serve with an ecosystem that enhances safety, security, and health."", This partnership will provide dispatchers with access to real-time information, such as the location of the person needing assistance and the responding public safety officer, viewable on a single monitor. The Axon and RapidSOS solution will accelerate the application of Next Generation 911 (NG911) capabilities by integrating rich data from both Axon and RapidSOS. It will enable public safety agencies to better manage resources and response times, enabling more efficient resolutions of emergencies and better outcomes., ""We are excited about this partnership, as we currently use both RapidSOS and the suite of Axon technology,"" said Michelle Potts, Communications Manager at the Chandler Police Department. ""These tools will provide our emergency dispatch teams with additional life-saving information, in real time, as well as provide visibility to better assist any type of emergency."", ""We are thrilled to partner with RapidSOS to further unleash the power of our investment in the Axon Respond real-time operations platform to deliver faster, safer and more efficient responses by unifying and delivering rich data to emergency response coordinators and first responders alike,"" said Axon Chief Product Officer and EVP of Software, Jeff Kunins. ""Many agencies already rely on both Axon and RapidSOS to manage emergency response. By enabling our solutions to work seamlessly together, we empower first responders with a single source for mission critical information as well as the ability to deliver industry-leading tools for agencies to securely and more efficiently manage resources and thereby respond faster than ever."", The rollout of this integration is expected to begin this year.

Through the integration with Axon's real-time operations platform, Respond for Devices, command staff and 911 dispatchers will be able to access live-streamed views from on-the-ground body cameras and drone footage, providing a more comprehensive picture of an incident. Additionally, Skydio's state-of-the-art flight autonomy engine and 3D adaptive scanning software, Skydio 3D Scan, will enhance public safety operations and efficiency by automating scans of crime and accident scenes to create accurate 3D reconstruction models., ""Over the last year, we've seen strong momentum of Skydio drones in public safety,"" said Mark Cranney, Skydio COO.

"Officers will be equipped with Axon Fleet in-vehicle and Axon Body 3 cameras to increase officer and civilian safety ROME, March 5, 2021 - Axon (Nasdaq: AXON), a global leader in connected technologies for law enforcement, today announced that the local police in Latisana, Riviera Friulana, will be the first city in Italy to implement Axon's in-car video system, Axon Fleet 2 and Axon Interview, a technology solution to securely capture video of witness and suspect interviews. Latisana local police have also purchased the Axon Body 3 cameras including licenses to its digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence.  Camera systems found in law enforcement vehicles are often unwieldy and inefficient, and more importantly, not connected to hardware and software systems used by public safety agencies. Axon’s Fleet 2 in-car system provides a streamlined, connected approach for law enforcement officers to securely share critical video footage into Axon Evidence, and eliminates the need for DVRs and other outdated, bulky hardware found in standard in-car video systems. ""We are very excited that the Latisana local police force is the first in Italy to use our in-car Fleet video system and Interview Room solution,"" says Loris Angeloni, Managing Director of Axon in Italy. ""This will be the first step towards an increasingly broad use of our devices in Italy and will help ensure public safety and officer protection. Axon has always offered a network of devices, applications and people that help law enforcement agencies be safer and give them the confidence, attention and time they need to keep their communities safe."" As a part of this deal, Latisana police will also be utilizing Axon Interview, a dedicated camera solution which allows officers to conduct interrogations more efficiently and ensure the integrity and security of all video. The full interview room video solution provides critical, defensible evidence for the prosecution allowing police agencies to tag and store video evidence securely in Axon Evidence. Corps Commander Nicola SALVATO: ""Since I have got to know and to study Axon’s philosophy, I trusted in and embraced these cutting-edge concepts. The opportunity to acquire high quality images, operational content, witnesses’ information that cannot be modified, but, especially, the opportunity to identify the proxemics of the ""interviewed"" person provides information that, increasingly today, for processes, make the difference. The benefit is that of providing Justice with a circumstantial/evidential compendium of greater depth. I believe that, thanks also to our suggestions, it will be possible to easily organize the law enforcement's activity in an ever more professional and safe way, in this third millennium taking account of these important improvements."" The Councillor for Security Piercarlo Daneluzzi: ""Our police forces today have to operate in increasingly complex and constantly evolving contexts. It follows that the role of the local police, in this context, is becoming increasingly important within our communities, from the largest to the smallest towns. In order to face present and future challenges in the best possible way, it is necessary to focus on an ever-increasing professionalism of the operators, which, first of all, is developed, on one hand, through training and constant updates of the personnel, on the other hand, through the use of technologically advanced tools such as these, which allow them to operate effectively and in step with the times.

"Ontario is the first Province in Canada to connect all justice sector partners and stakeholders via Canadian cloud-based software-as-a-service, Axon Evidence, and other innovative applications including Axon Citizen, TORONTO, March 3, 2021 /CNW/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AXON), the global leader in connected public safety technologies, and its subsidiary, Axon Public Safety Canada, Inc., today announced that the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Ontario is deploying Axon's digital evidence management solution, Axon Evidence, to the Ontario Provincial Police and multiple municipal police services across Ontario. This groundbreaking modernization initiative will connect all Ontario justice sector partners and stakeholders, including the police, courts, crown attorneys, defence counsel and corrections. Axon Evidence is a Canadian cloud-based digital evidence platform that allows agencies and investigators to store, manage, transfer and share digital evidence across all public safety agencies. Axon was selected through the province's open and competitive procurement process for a provincial digital evidence management solution (DEMS)., , As a part of this announcement, the Ministry will also be supporting public submission of digital evidence via Axon Citizen. Axon Citizen allows critical evidence to be securely submitted by citizens into Axon Evidence where the software's powerful features can be used to easily create a chain of custody and assess, catalogue and search all forms of digital evidence anywhere in the province. In today's connected world, crimes are becoming more complex and influenced by technology. Collecting digital evidence has become critical to public safety in criminal investigations, while agencies are dealing with an ever-growing backlog of data. The current practices of physically sharing digital evidence using CDs, DVDs and USB-transfers are expensive, impractical and an inefficient use of resources, especially in a province the size of Ontario. Axon Citizen allows community members to submit evidence directly to police services, from their mobile devices, for specific crimes under investigation., ""This investment will help drive forward our ongoing efforts to modernize Ontario's criminal justice system by transforming the way digital evidence is managed by police and justice partners,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""By eliminating the need for sharing and transporting evidence in person, police officers will spend less time carrying out administrative work and more time on what matters most – protecting our communities."", ""Collaboration, integration, and technology have served as the cornerstones of the recent progress that Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney has made in moving the justice system forward,"" said Ontario Attorney General Doug Downey. ""By continuing to leverage technology and critical partnerships, we are doing away with antiquated systems that have hindered and slowed down the delivery of justice in Ontario. Digital evidence management will eliminate unnecessary repetitive processes, ensure the timely delivery of information, and reduce the impacts of case delays."", ""The number of resources and administrative time spent on managing evidentiary data through the justice sector is a major challenge that continues to grow. We're excited to be partnering with the Ministry on such a critical project for the police services in Ontario with a proven solution that can help first responders and public safety officials streamline evidence management and support timely submissions to the courts, ultimately reducing costs and helping reallocate resources to better serve the community,"" says Vishal Dhir, Managing Director for Axon Canada and Latin America., This announcement ensures that Axon Evidence will be made available to provincial public safety agencies including the Ontario Provincial Police, First Nations police, and the Correctional Services Oversight and Investigations unit along with municipal police services, will be at the leading edge of innovation in digital evidence management for years to come while continuing to hold criminals accountable and better protecting victims of crime., The Ministry has been implementing this initiative in multiple phases around the province since the end of last year, and is launching new deployments throughout the first half of 2021., About Axon Public Safety Canada, Axon is a network of devices, apps, and people that help law enforcement and public safety personnel become smarter and safer.

"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 25, 2021 /PRNewswire/ --, , Dear Shareholders,, Every day, we hear stories about how our products are improving policing and driving safer outcomes for everyone., SITUATION: OFFICER IN TROUBLE, Agency: Midwestern agency with about 1,000 sworn officers, Incident: An officer was involved in a struggle with a subject and began to radio for help, but couldn't complete the communication or broadcast her location or status. The agency's real- time crime center personnel used Axon Respond to geographically locate her and livestream from her Axon Body 3 camera — accessing critical awareness simply and securely from a Web browser., Personnel saw that the suspect had grabbed ahold of one of the officer's arms. The agency dispatched backup support and the responding officers completed the arrest with no injuries to the officer or suspect. An agency supervisor said, ""The technology is irreplaceable in critical incidences. It's always been well-appreciated by the police officers. Can't say enough about how important it was for that officer that day."", In 2020, we solidified the foundation for our next decade of growth. First and foremost, we served our customers, team members and communities during a global pandemic. At the same time, we secured our first Dispatch customer, established a solid foothold in the Federal market, launched our Respond platform and grew our international revenue by more than 70%. We are proud to have delivered a record $681 million in revenue, representing 28% growth, $1.2 billion in contract bookings, and $221 million in annual recurring revenue. We wrapped up the year with an exceptional fourth quarter, highlighted by revenue growth of 32%, strong profitability and robust global demand for our TASER devices. The results showcase the leverage in our business model., Our mission — from day one of our founding — has always been to obsolete the bullet. That has evolved in tandem with societal changes. Today we also aim to reduce social conflict and enable a fair and effective social justice system. We are on a clear path to making Axon synonymous with public and personal safety. We are investing today for a reality where officers reach for their TASER device before they reach for a firearm, because they feel safer doing so. We're investing in body cameras that capture truth and add real-time awareness, and in cloud software that drives efficiency and insights to help everyone get home safe., We are proud to have created products that many have come to associate with modern best practices in policing., Our objectives in 2021 are to:, The pace of our global expansion has hastened. In 2020, we continued to build out our sales force in English-speaking markets. In 2021, we are expanding our investments in international markets, including several major countries in Europe. These new markets are demonstrating the potential to mirror Axon's top tier markets like the US, UK, Australia and Canada. International customers are increasingly showing interest in large deployments and adoption of Axon's expanding product portfolio — and we are putting the requisite sales, account management, and engineering muscle behind that., In 2021, we are continuing to increase our investments in R&D across all of Axon's product lines. This is enabling us to accelerate the pace of innovation for our core customers, and will help us address new markets and customer segments. Our investments in innovation have allowed us to offer a wider range of valuable bundles to customers, including the introduction of our new highest-tier premium bundle at $239 per officer per month over five years — it includes a TASER device, body camera, and access to many existing products within our cloud software suite, and adds expanded virtual reality (""VR"") training and unlimited AI-powered transcription for body camera video., , Axon product growth drivers, At the start of the year, we like to provide an update on our rapidly growing and evolving product suite., Axon products are generally cloud-connected, designed to drive better outcomes and customer experiences, and sold via mutually reinforcing integrated bundles, where all products work together. Our key revenue drivers belong to three broad product categories:, Looking back: Select Q4 2020 highlights, Federal customer expansion continued: Axon signed a $5 million digital evidence management software contract with an agency within the Department of Justice, completed several federal task force pilot programs across the Department of Justice, and worked to begin scheduled software deployments for 12,500 attorneys in the US Attorneys Office (EOUSA.) In the quarter, Axon also started formal deployments under the Departments of Interior's IDIQ contract and conducted pilot programs across the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and the Veteran's Administration., Axon Respond live-stream usage increased 7x from April to December: And live map usage increased 5x in that period. We also signed more than 20 customers that were not municipal law enforcement agencies, including a hospital system complex. We have found that the hospital system is using live maps and streaming more than any other user, which is an encouraging early sign of the broader utility of this technology., Green Bay Packers partner with Green Bay Police Department on TASER 7 and body camera deployment: The NFL team made a financial contribution to the local police department to help fund Axon's Officer Safety Plan 7+ integrated bundle, as part of the team's ongoing pledge to support its hometown. Green Bay PD is promoting a culture of ongoing learning and development as the latest agency to roll out Axon's Replay Coaching feature. The feature helps officers learn and improve from real experiences in the field, the same way as athletes receive game day coaching., ""In conversations with our players, community partners and elected officials, we determined that supporting this purchase would complement our many other efforts to address injustices in our communities of color. The cameras will also help the police perform their duties more effectively and benefit the local community.

These investments yielded results ahead of our expectations, as evidenced by our strong 2020 finish. We intend to continue investing for growth in 2021., Our updated 2021 outlook is as follows:, Thank you for joining us on our growth journey,, Rick Smith, CEOLuke Larson, PresidentJawad Ahsan, CFO, Quarterly conference call and webcast, We will host our Q4 2020 earnings conference call webinar on Thursday, February 25 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET., The webcast will be available via a link on Axon's investor relations website at https://investor.axon.com, or can be accessed directly via https://axon.zoom.us/j/96921631701., Statistical Definitions, Bookings: We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, inclusive of renewals, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided, so long as they are expected to occur within five years. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods. Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although we have entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipate the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate funds in future year budgets, or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings. Bookings, as presented here, represent total company bookings inclusive of all products, and should not be confused with our historical reported measure of Software & Sensors bookings, which excluded TASER-related bookings. Certain customers sign contracts for time periods longer than five-years, which generates a larger-sized booking — but the expected exercise amounts after the five-year period is not included in bookings, as described here, in order to facilitate comparisons between periods., Net revenue retention: Dollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers. We calculate it as the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of agency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This calculation includes high-margin warranty but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription contingent of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments -- meaning that for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution. For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings., Total company future contracted revenue: Total company future contracted revenue includes both recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts that will be invoiced and recognized in future periods. The remaining performance obligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606 as of December 31, 2020. We expect to recognize between 20% - 25% of this balance over the next twelve months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following five to seven years, subject to risks related to delayed deployments, budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses., Non-GAAP Measures, To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented herein., Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures, Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:, Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies., About Axon, Axon is the global leader in connected public safety technologies.

Words such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""predict,"" ""potential,"" ""continue,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""future,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""believe,"" ""estimate,"" and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words., We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: the potential global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; our exposure to cancellations of government contracts due to appropriation clauses, exercise of a cancellation clause, or non-exercise of contractually optional periods; our ability to design, introduce and sell new products or features; our ability to defend against litigation and protect our intellectual property, and the resulting costs of this activity; our ability to manage our supply chain and avoid production delays, shortages, and impacts to expected gross margins; the impact of stock compensation expense, impairment expense, and income tax expense on our financial results; customer purchase behavior, including adoption of our software as a service delivery model; negative media publicity regarding our products; the impact of product mix on projected gross margins; defects in our products; changes in the costs of product components and labor; loss of customer data, a breach of security, or an extended outage, including by our third party cloud-based storage providers; exposure to international operational risks; delayed cash collections and possible credit losses due to our subscription model; changes in government regulations in the U.S. and in foreign markets, especially related to the classification of our products by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; and counter-party risks relating to cash balances held in excess of FDIC insurance limits. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q list various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These factors are intended as cautionary statements for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act and Section 27A of the Securities Act. Readers can find them under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K and in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and investors should refer to them. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties., Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC., Update on Legal Matters:, Axon v. FTC, Axon continues to both vigorously prosecute its Federal court constitutional case against the FTC and defend the FTC's separate antitrust administrative action against the company. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the FTC's administrative hearing that was scheduled to begin in October 2020 to preserve the status quo pending its ruling on Axon's appeal., As background, Axon's Federal court constitutional challenge against the FTC was dismissed in April 2020, without prejudice, for lack of jurisdiction, holding that Axon must first bring its claims through the FTC's administrative process. Axon appealed that ruling to the Ninth Circuit (No. 20-15662). In January 2021, a Ninth Circuit panel in a 2-1 split decision ruled against Axon on the jurisdictional question. Axon intends to file a petition for rehearing en banc with an expanded 11-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit and thereafter may file a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. The panel dissent is strong and well-reasoned and even the majority opinion recognizes the legitimate and serious constitutional questions Axon has raised about the FTC's ""stunning win rate"" and whether the agency ""has stacked the deck in its favor in its administrative proceedings."", We believe the administrative hearing will remain on hold until all appellate avenues have run their course, which could take up to a year or more to fully resolve. Copies of the Court's recent opinion and other Federal court filings can be found on Axon's FTC Investor Briefing page at https://www.axon.com/ftc., As a reminder, in parallel to these matters Axon is evaluating strategic alternatives to litigation, which Axon might pursue if determined to be in the best interests of shareholders and customers. This could include a divestiture of the Vievu entity and/or related assets. While Axon continues to believe the acquisition of Vievu in 2018 was lawful and a benefit to Vievu's customers, the cost, risk and distraction of protracted litigation merit consideration of settlement if achievable on terms agreeable to the FTC and Axon., For investor relations information please contact Andrea James and Angel Ambrosio via email at IR@axon.com., AXON ENTERPRISE, INC.,
